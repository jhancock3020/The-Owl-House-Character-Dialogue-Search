Luz: And that's the end.
Luz: My book report. [the snake hisses and bites the doll] I think I knocked it out of the park.
Luz: Oh. That's where the backup snakes were.
Luz: That was for the Act Three closer.
Luz: O happy dagger, give me death!
Luz: Now for the final anatomically correct touch, spider breath.
Luz: You think that's an impressive trick? [throws her pom-poms to the side] Take a look at this. [turns around to reveal she flipped her eyelids inside out] Bleep, bloop, bleep!
Luz: Don't worry, Mom. I won't let you down. [stands up triumphantly] No more weirdness!
Luz: That doesn't count, right?
Luz: But I don't like any of that stuff. I like editing anime clips to music and- and reading fantasy books with convoluted backstories.
Luz: Yes, Mom.
Luz: Bye, Mom. [watches her leave, then gasps and rummages through the bin] Where is it? Where is it?
Luz: Tiny trash thief!
Luz: [growls]
Luz: Stop adorably hopping away, you‐‐ Huh? [looks around the tent, which is full of old odds and ends] Whoa. I thought I had a lot of weird stuff. [grabs a creepy-looking doll] But this? This is impressive.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: [gasps; runs out of the tent and grabs her book back] Excuse me, sorry, it's mine, thank you.
Luz: Wah-ah!
Luz: [backing away from the cliff] Oh, no, no, no, no! What's going on? [shrieks as a fairy approaches her] Oh, hello, little fairy. Are you going to tell me this is all a fantastical dream?
Luz: [screams, slaps the fairy into the ground] Where am I? Did I die? Am I in the bad place?
Luz: [sits down on a stool] I'm so sorry! I just wanted my book! If you're gonna eat my skin, [offers her arm and closes her eyes] just make it quick! Just do it now!
Luz: [opens her eyes]
Luz: [looks at Eda and laughs] That's not all it can do. Here, let me see it.
Luz: Voilà!
Luz: I'm Luz. Luz Noceda.
Luz: That's kind of a weird thing for another human to say.
Luz: A witch?
Luz: [peeking over the edge of the table] Whoa! Witch criminal!
Luz: Aah!
Luz: Wh‐What? That's not cool!
Luz: [following Eda] This is crazy. If I die here, my mom's gonna kill me!
Luz: Wait. What's that supposed to‐‐
Luz: [does so, yells and nearly falls off the staff when she sees the ground below them] Flying staffs, crazy monsters, you're a witch! What is this place?
Luz: A griffin!
Luz: I knew it!
Luz: Giraffes?
Luz: Aaah! [jumps off the staff]
Luz: [stands] Well, I've had enough adventure for today. This is clearly not the PG fantasy world I always dreamed about. So, can you help me get back home?
Luz: Whoa!
Luz: [looking over her shoulder] Aren't you worried about those guards finding us?
Luz: This place is beautiful! [puts her book onto a coffee table] Do you live here all alone?
Luz: [gasps] ¡Ay, que lindo! [runs forward and scoops King up in a hug] Eda, he's so cute! Who's a widdle guy? Who's a widdle guy? Is it you? Is it you?
Luz: Wait, wait, wait. I don't like the sound of this "situation".
Luz: You mean this little bundle of joy?
Luz: So I don't really have a choice, do I?
Luz: Where are we going?
Luz: [notices Eda's wanted poster on the wall they're hiding behind] Whoa. These guys really have the hots for you.
Luz: [gasps] Will I need a disguise?
Luz: I've been waiting to use this. [pulls her hood on, flicks up cat ears] Meow, meow.
Luz: Whoa!
Luz: [also grunting as she pulls herself up and in, falling on her face]
Luz: [sits up and gasps]
Luz: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not a cat. [pulls her hood down] Also, I'm not a criminal.
Luz: [pacing around] Wait. These aren't crimes. None of you actually did anything wrong. [pulls out Eda's wanted poster] You're all just a bunch of weirdos. Like me.
Luz: [exclaims and runs into an open cell, pulling the door down as she enters]
Luz: [whimpers]
Luz: Don't worry. I can get you out. [pulls on the lever, but can't lift it] No! My weak nerd arms!
Luz: It's not fair that they're all in here. They just want to be themselves. Why does everyone think that being a weirdo is so bad?
Luz: [takes a breath]
[Luz puts a hand against the pillar before walking through it. Inside are piles of what can only be described as as junk: everything from books to skulls to a dead fish in a tank. Atop the central one is a glowing crown.]
Luz: Wait a second. Is that a...
Luz: That crown doesn't give him any powers, does it?
Luz: [grins and blushes]
Luz: [screams]
Luz: [screams louder and longer]
Luz: Eda! Are you okay?
Luz: Does it?
Luz: [disgusted] What?
Luz: I hate everything you're saying right now.
Luz: Okay, we're going now.
Luz: Expecto... flying? Magicus... escapicus!
Luz: Eda, lend me a hand!
Luz: What about you guys?
Luz: But‐‐ But I‐‐
Luz: [whimpering as she tries to not fall off the staff]
Luz: Why are you guys just standing there? This is your chance to escape!
Luz: So, you have a different way of doing things, a different way of seeing things. That might make you weird, but it also makes you awesome. Don't you see?
Luz: Because us weirdos have to stick together. [pulls her hood on and mounts the staff] And nobody should be punished for who they are.
Luz: Now, let's get 'em!
Luz: Go, go, go, go!
Luz: [points at Wrath] Do not underestimate me, Warden Wrath, for I am Luz, the human, warrior of peace. [wind blows her hair] Now eat this, sucka!
Luz: Before I go... [holds out the head of her Azura doll] I know it's not the same, but... [removes Azura's crown] a king shouldn't be without a crown.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Okay. I know you got your head cut off, and we started some kind of prison riot, but this was the most fun I've ever had.
Luz: I don't fit in at home. You don't fit in here. If I stay, we could not fit in together. [she looks at the pamphlet for Reality Check one last time, then crumples it] I'm not going back to summer camp.
Luz: I want to stay and become a witch. Like you. [holds her book up to Eda] And Azura.
Luz: Maybe that's because they haven't tried. If you teach me to become a witch, I'll do anything you want.
[Luz sits up and pats the sleeping bag. King curls up at the bottom below her feet and falls asleep. Luz smiles at him before replying to her mom: I think I'm gonna like it here". Smiling, she puts her phone down, turns to the side, and falls asleep.]

Luz: King, listen to this!
Luz: [sits up] Sorry! Now that I'll be a student at Hexside, I wanna learn all about it! I've got a new crush, and her name is Education!
Luz: Is it your birthday!?
Luz: You can have my trash. Whoa! Did you know that Hexside was built on the bones of its rival school? One it literally conquered!
Luz: Can you imagine it! Me, in the halls of Hexside, studying with Willow and Gus and- maybe even Amity! Amity! Oh cramity! We're supposed to meet so I can get my Azura book back! [runs out, slams door; reopens door] I love you guys!
Luz: [running and looking around] Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity. Gotta find that- oh! [Sees the girl in question, wearing a new outfit.] There she is. Hey Amity! Luz is finally here!
Luz: Aa! [falls on her back]
Luz: [takes the book] So, what'd you think?
Luz: [pulls a drawing out of the book] So fine you drew yourself with Malingale the Mysterious Soothsayer?
Luz: This is great! Maybe we could even start an Azura club at school when we're classmates!
Luz: Surprise! [pulls out the pamphlet] I'm enrolling at Hexside!
Luz: Placement exam? Spells?
Luz: Pff. Yeah. 'Course I know two spells! [laughs nervously]
Luz: Uh, actually, I have other training plans in a very far away place that I have to go to right now. [pretends to walk away] Bye! [actually leaves]
Luz: [slams the front door open] Edaaaa!
Luz: [runs in] Eda, Eda! Eda! [falls] You have to teach me a new spell right now!
Luz: [stands] But I need to know two spells to get into decent classes at Hexside. I can make light glyphs. [pulls one out and activates it]
Luz: But at the end of the day, that's the only spell I know. [falls face-first to the floor]
Luz: [muffled] Yours!
Luz: [stands] Just teach me a spell now. Any spell! It can be the darkest evil.
Luz: Come on Eda! You're the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles. How would it look if your apprentice got thrown into the baby class?
Luz: Aww, he stamped his little foot!
Luz: Yes!
Luz: [climbs onto the counter; louder] Yes!
Luz: YES!
Luz: [gasps] It's beautiful!
Luz: [screams]
Luz: [yelps, runs off]
Luz: I'll definitely learn my second spell here! Gorgeous views, magic in the air. And best of all, we're completely alone!
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: [ducks back down, hides her face with her hat] Forget teaching me a spell, just make me disappear.
Luz: Okay, let's do this. [stands and waves] Hey guys!
Luz: [grabs Eda's jacket] Be cool! If they know I haven't mastered two spells, they'll think I belong in the baby class!
Luz: Amity! [slips, poses on the ground] Wha... What are you doing here?
Luz: Yup! Powerful spells! I'm workin' on one that's so crazy! Eda's a pretty incredible teacher.
Luz: Eda! Can you please take this seriously?
Luz: [looks downcast]
Luz: [nods] Okay. I trust you.
Luz: Ugh. Okay. I've identified the smells of three different rocks, sorted all the twigs from big to small, and found your glove, and your hand. [lifts glove off of Eda's detached hand]
Luz: So what now?
Luz: [giggles]
Luz: With all my heart.
Luz: [takes deep breath] Alright, Luz. Look. Look with everything you've got. Focus. [raises her right hand and speaks through it]
Luz's Right Hand: Focus? On what? On you'll be stuck in the baby class?
Luz: No! Don't think like that!
Luz's Left Hand: Face it, you'll never get a second spell following Eda's lessons.
Luz: Silence, hands!
Luz: If I wanna be in the same class as Amity, I'm gonna need to learn magic like Amity.
Luz's Left Hand: Great work, Luz!
Luz: Shh! I don't need your validation.
Luz: Huh. Her crosshatching has improved.
Luz: Oh man, oh man. [stands and draws a circle with the wand; gasps] Yes!
Luz: I did magic! I did magic!! [jumps in place] Without drawing anything! This thing is the coolest!
Luz: I'm doing magic, what would you have me do? Eat more snow? Lick a rock?
Luz: Well, it's already helped me. Just watch what I can do!
Luz: Wh... whoaaa!
Luz: Will it accept a heartfelt apology?
Luz: [screams]
Luz: Eda!
Luz: Um...
Luz: I... I didn't know!
Luz: But I don't actually... know any.
Luz: What do we do?
Luz: But the beast has Eda!
Luz: Amity! Wait! [gets shocked by Amity's cage] Stupid island. [kicks rock] Ugh! Ow. [sits on the rock, looks at the Titan's Skull] You were supposed to teach me magic.
Luz: But I'll never learn more than this.
Luz: Wait. Is that...
Luz: ...a light glyph? But what does that mean?
Luz: Whoa.
Luz: It means... magic is a gift from the island. It means...
Luz: ...magic is everywhere!
Luz: Magic is everywhere!
Luz: Woooo-- aaah! [lands in the snow] My second spell! [pops out] Thank you, snow! Thank you, island! Thank you, Eda. [pauses] Eda! I have to save her. [She gets out of her hole and runs.]
Luz: That's right. [pops up with a skull over her face] Death is here. [lifts skull] Just kidding, Luz is here!
Luz: Don't worry, Eda, I get it now. I was so obsessed with learning my second spell, I didn't listen to you. But now I'm gonna save you! [jumps away] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Luz: [grinning] Hello!
Luz: Magic! Literally! Now, forget that, because you and I are gonna have to work together if we want to save everyone. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. [whispers to Amity]
Luz: Hey! You big idiot! [waves her arms] Over here!
Luz: [screams]
Luz: Gotcha!
Luz: Now that's my mentor! [runs up to Eda] Did you see? I learned my second spell, I made the connection!
Luz: Azura Book Club? Azura Book Club!
Luz: On it, teach!
Eda and Luz: [cheers]

Luz: Ooh, magic 'sghetti. [tries to touch it]
Luz: [stares at the wool adoringly] I'm worth salt... I want cloak! 
Luz: [stares at her intensely] I think I finally understand why the Emperor wants you so badly. [jokingly] He's got the hots for you, doesn't he?
Luz: And he won't stop until he's got you... [droops head]
Luz: King!
Luz: Get the elixir! Now! 
Luz: Hey, your gem! It's still dark!
Luz: [points finger] The curse has been getting worse and you've been hiding it!
Luz: What happens if you use your magic up? Do you... do you die?!
Luz: No! No, I-I can't let that happen! I'll do something about it. I'll find a cure and then--
Luz: [sadly pouts with puppy eyes at Eda]
Luz: [immediately beams and hugs Eda]
Luz: Get rest! Drink lots of water! Stay out of the sun! Lift with your knees, not your--
Luz: Poor Eda. Enemies everywhere, even her own body. I wish I could help her.
Luz: Right. I was actually gonna stay behind. I don't like the way they treat Eda.
Luz: Like what?
Luz: Mmm...
Luz: [reading] "The Healing Hat. Made from the magic of the Savage Ages. It is said to cure the deadliest diseases... and heal any curse"?
Luz: Mmm. [picks up book] You've done so much for me, Eda. Now I'm gonna do something for you.
[Cut to Luz's notebook. She has drawn the Healing Hat and written: "HEALING HAT HEIST 1. Sneak into castle! 2. Steal healing hat 3. Lift curse".]
Luz: Ah! [hides notepad] Um, what was that, Willow?
Luz: So, Willow... would you say this Belos guy is like, powerful?
Luz: [struggling to open vent, notices Willow and Gus looking at her] Heh... Uh, love me a properly ventilated castle!
Luz: [gasps, ducks around a corner]
Luz: Hmm.
Luz: Please don't notice I'm gone, please don't notice I'm-- boarding the bus?
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Wah!
Luz: Oh! Guys. I, uh....
Luz: [sighs] You got me. But you don't understand. Eda has this curse and it's zapping away her magic, and--
Luz: [almost crying] Thanks, guys. I know exactly what we gotta do. It's time for a heist!
Luz: Healing Hat. Mmm! You're Eda's last hope. [grabs hat, which glows] I-I can feel it! I can feel the magic flowing!
Luz: Now we can cure Eda and get this hat back before anyone knows it's gone. [laughs]
Luz: We need to go. Now.
Luz and Gus: [gasp]
Luz: [coughs]
Luz: Come on, let's go! [gasps]
Luz: Stay away! If you touch us, Eda will come after you so fast--
Luz: No!
Luz: No! I needed that to heal your sister!
Luz: Eda!
Luz: [yells]
Luz: Eda! Your gem! [bangs on the bubble]
Luz: [gasp]
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Eda, stop! Your magic!
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: [screams]
Luz: Eda, stop! You'll run out of magic!
Luz: Eda, no, no, no!
Luz: Please, no!
Luz: Eda.
Luz: You monster!
Luz: Hi, Hooty.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: [gasps]

Luz: Okay. Attempt number twenty-three. [To Eda] Thanks again for agreeing to help, Eda.
Luz: Your very presence is help enough.
Luz: Wait, Hooty was—
Luz: A spell that has a very slim chance of working. But, if it does, it might get me back to the Human Realm.
Luz: We have to be very careful. This spell is unstable and—Eda!
Luz: Oh, shoot!
Luz: I worry what you think you know about humans.
Luz: Hold on, Eda. Do you hear that?
Luz & Anne: [Simultaneously, while falling] Aaaah!
Luz: Me neither. I'm Luz Noceda, and I am very impressed that you're walking around with one shoe.
Luz: Why do I get the feeling we have a lot in common?
Luz: Leave this one to me, guys.
Luz: I'm a witch—well, kind of a witch-in-training… But, I come from the human world originally.
Luz: Actually, searching for a way home.
Luz: Mmh, less of a medieval fantasy, and more of a kid-friendly hellscape on top of a giant carcass, but… yep!
Luz: And I got questions for you. Where’d you learn how to fight like that? Do you have a found family too? Or a horrifying authority figure to fight?
Luz: [Gasps] Oh-no! We’re out of time! [To Eda] I told you this thing would be unstable! [To Anne] I’m sorry Anne, we’ve got to go!
Luz: In another life, Anne, we'll have that sleepover. In another life!
Luz: You got that right. Take care Anne… I love your hair!
Luz: Another human girl, and I barely got to talk to her! I didn’t even get a memento to remember her by.
Luz: Eda! Did you steal that poor frog-man's wallet!?
Luz: Quick! We gotta open the portal and return it!

Luz: I'm glad you asked that question, King. Drawing can be fun once you know a few tricks. [starts drawing King] I like to break characters down into simple shapes. Here's you, [flips paper up] and Eda is made of these shapes. [flips paper again to a blank page] Hooty is really easy. [draws Hooty] He's just a circle and a tube.
Luz: [voiceover] Hooty?
Luz: [attempting to restrain him] Hooty, stop!
Luz: That's the magic of drawing with good proportions. It makes things look real.

Luz: Ooh.
Luz: Buddy, let me tell you a little something about fan fiction.
 
7 https://theowlhouse.fandom.com/wiki/Covention/Transcript
 
Luz: Emboldened by the dishonor Hecate had shown, Azura lifted her staff to the cotton-candy skies and shouted, "I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!" And look! I drew a flip book. [flips between two pages] Pew, pew, pew!
Luz: What?
Luz: Wait. I thought you were the King of Demons. Are you just making this up now?
Luz: Well, I can offer you more of this tantalizing book.
Luz: Um, Eda? [zoom out to the empty street] What customers? There aren't even any other stands around. What's going on?
Luz: Gus, Willow! Hey!
Luz: A job fair for witches! Eda, can we go?
Luz: [groans, drops to the ground]
Luz: "We"?
Luz: [pops back up] Who's "we"? You have a mysterious past! Now we gotta go!
Luz: Okay. Then you leave me no choice.
Luz: [grunts as she tries to shove Eda's hair in the cowl] Is this cowl really necessary?
Luz: Whoa. Was I even alive before now?
Luz: [stops and points] Ooh, what's that?
Luz: Yowza-wowza!
Illusion Luz: Yowza-wowza!
Luz: Yowza-wha-a-a?
Luz: Wow! Acceptance? Comradery? A sense of belonging? Covens sound incredible! Eda, why haven't you ever joined one?
Luz: That panel looks popular.
Luz: Aren't you coming, Eda?
Luz: I get it, Eda. Covens: bad. Individualism: good. But I'm still figuring this world out, so I'm going to go in there and make up my own mind, okay? [She walks in.]
Luz: Whoa. [looks to the side and waves]
Luz: Hmm?
Luz: You know her?
Luz: [gasps] Mysterious past!
Luz: Eda! Where are you going?
Luz: But we haven't even taken the quiz to determine our coven type!
Luz: Ooh, a punky potionist.
Luz: Uh... Hey, Amity. So, funny story. Not an abomination. Sorry for the confusion last week. I-I'm Luz. The human. Hi!
Luz: [follows her] Well, to be fair, you were okay with him trying to dissect me, so--
Luz: Well, I'm learning how to be a witch. I'm receiving magic lessons from a powerful witch and a ferocious demon.
Luz: Why are you being so mean, Amity?
Luz: [hugs him] He's a very good boy and the King of Demons! I'll tell you what, Amity. [stands] It's one thing to say I can't be a witch--
Luz: ...but it's another thing to bully my friends. Just like The Good Witch Azura said when facing down her rival Hecate at the Bog of Immediate Regret... I challenge you to a Witch's Duel!
Luz: One, if I win, you apologize to King for squashing his cupcake.
Luz: And two, you admit that humans can be witches too.
Luz: Fine. Let's shake on it.
Luz: That's probably fine.
Luz: King, I-I can win this, right?
Luz: [whimpers]
Luz: [pops up between them] Eda, I need your help! I accidentally challenged Amity to a witch's duel, and I think she's going to kill me all the way dead! [slumps to the ground]
Luz: But... whose blood?
Luz: [sits up] I-Is there a glowy hand thing that happens, or, uh--
Luz: I can't believe I'm gonna have to stop learning magic!
Luz: Eda? [grabs Eda's arms] What am I going to do?
Luz: That's cheating!
Luz: But I will know in my heart! Even if I win now, I lose.
Luz: [whimpers]
Luz: I'm not good under pressure! [runs]
Luz: [panting] Whoa!
Luz: I, uh-- [she does jazz hands] Magic?
Luz: Not dying!
Luz: [screams and runs]
Luz: [sees the mound] No, Amity, don't step any closer!
Luz: [to Eda] Spikes?
Luz: Amity-- No!
Luz: It wasn't my idea to cheat. And when I found out, I tried to stop it, but--
Luz: Amity, wait!
Luz: [pats King's head] You'll get more offerings, King. [runs after Amity]
Luz: [gasps] Amity... [walks over] I'm sorry.
Luz: I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Luz: Yeah, but--
Luz: [looks at the ground] I'm not a witch.
Luz: But I'm training hard to be one.
Luz: It doesn't come naturally to me like it does for you, so I've had to improvise. [nods to the notepad]
Luz: Did it work? Can I still learn magic?
Luz: Yeah, sorry. Your legs are just so tiny. Should we get you more offerings?
Luz: [gasps] Is it love?
Luz: How'd you get away from Lilith?
Luz: Eda...
Luz: Do you think I'll ever be a true witch?
Luz: [brightens] My own witch.
Luz: Sister? Now that's a mysterious past payoff!
Luz: What? You've got parents? I need to know more!

Luz: Hmmm...
Luz: In a minute, King. I'm getting so close to figuring out this glyph combo.
Luz: Why don't you ask Lilith for help? She was in the Emperor's Coven. She has more experience with unruly mobs than anyone.
Luz: Oh, I think they're actually friends. Isn't that nice? [closes her book and stands up, holding a glyph] Okay, this will work for sure. Now you see me...
Luz: ...now you don't. Oh, I guess it only lasts as long as I hold my breath. Still pretty cool, huh?
Luz: [shaking King off her leg] Well, since you guys discovered that we can make new spells by combining glyphs, I've been experimenting. I got the invisibility idea from your history books, Lilith.
Luz: [like talking to a puppy] Aw, you're gonna be such a good tyrant. Who's the scariest demon king? Who is it?
Luz: Stop it, you guys. This story is really important to him, so the least we can do is play along.
Luz: Could you please just go with it? For his sake?
Luz: Uh...
Luz: Go with him! I said we should go with him, right? How could I forget what I just said?
Luz: Awww...
Luz: Ooh. A door fit for a tyrant.
Luz: [laughing] The only mystery is how Lilith can be so smart and so wrong at the same time. Academics, am I right?
Luz: With all the sugar I eat, it better be.
Luz: Yeah. [sheepish laugh] So much wonder.
Luz: [looking up] What was up there?
Luz: Well, uh... wanna head back? This is all so cool, but Eda's probably on her third cup of apple blood by now, and the last time, it was real hard getting her off the roof.
Luz: [getting up] "Your Majesty"?
Luz: Uh, guys, are you hearing this?
Luz: What are these things?
Luz: Just kidding. I'd never leave someone hanging. Up top, buddy.
Luz: Tour's over! We gotta go! Now!
Luz: This environment is not conducive to learning. It's conducive to death!
Luz: That one can. Let's go!
Luz: Dang, girl, you've been practicing!
Luz: Eda! We can fight it together!
Luz: We can't let her fight it alone! We have to go back!
Luz: That thing must be guarding this place against intruders.
Luz: Uh... u-um...
Luz: King, I...
Luz: King, it's gonna be okay.
Luz: KIIIING!
Luz: King?! Kiiiiing! Please, come back!
Luz: I lied to him, even thorough I knew he trusted me. Now, he's all alone.
Luz: Kiiiiing?! Kiiiiing?!
Luz: You are somebody. And I love that somebody very much. I'm sorry I lied about what I believed.
Luz: Something's not adding up. One of your memories is falling, right?
Luz: No! What if that's a real memory?
Luz: You said you remember a roar from up in that shaft. Maybe that's what you fell from! Eda found you in those ruins. There's gotta be a clue in there about where you came from.
Luz: You might have been alone before, but you have us now. Whatever we find up there won't change that. So, what do you say?
Luz: Great. Now, before we leave, we have one more thing to check out.
Luz: Hooty knows what to do.
Luz: I always wanted to do something like this?
Luz: FLY, FLY, FLY!
Luz: There's...
Luz: I knew there was something up here! I'm like the mystery whisperer. The butler did it, magnifying glass, secret door.
Luz: King, does any of this feel familiar to you?
Luz: King...
Luz: Maybe that was him on all those wall carvings.
Luz: [to King] Maybe you weren't exactly the King of Demons, but...
Luz: I'd do anything for you, buddy.
Luz, Eda and Lilith: No!
Luz: Whatcha doin' there, King?
Luz: Yeah. Too bad.
Luz: Well, you'll always be the king of my heart. That's good enough, right?
Luz: Bummer, looks like I'm all out of kisses. Maybe next time. Goodnight! [closes the door]
Luz: I don't know. But whatever we discover, we'll be there for King... no matter what.

Luz: Whoa... it's like I have snakes for arms.
Luz: [sits up, pulls out the portal key] If I ate the portal key, would I return to the human realm?
Luz: [reaches out] Um?
Luz: Mouse, Philip diary entry!
Luz: I have to go to Eclipse Lake! [runs towards the door] Ah!
Luz: Ugh!
Luz: You guys are the best. [hands over her drawing to Eda, who starts to leave]
Luz: Whoa... [gasps, then hisses at them causing Gus to flinch]
Luz: Little mouse, owl house, frilly blouse, boop!
Luz: [gasps] Oh no, I gotta warn them, gotta call!
Luz: Dang it!
Luz: [offscreen] Willow? Gus? Hooty!
Luz: Guys! [falls] Ugh! I gotta reach Amity! [gasps, sees her game device]
Luz: [snores] Huh? [sits up, pillow falls off her head revealing several mushrooms on it, pats face] I feel great! [sees and touches the mushrooms] I wonder if this is permanent. [gasps] I gotta find everyone!
Luz: Have the others returned?
Luz: Amity! [happily hugs her] I'm so glad my awesome girlfriend is okay.
Luz: Come here buddy! [hugs King tightly]

Luz: Pretty good, huh?
Luz: Well, it’s a common misconception that the tool is an important part of the process. As long as you’ve mastered the basics... [reaches into Eda's hair and pulls out lipstick]
Luz: Hoot, hoot. Then you can use pretty much anything to make a good drawing.
Luz: Yep, with practice and study, you can make fine art out of anything. [poses with a smile]
Luz: I guess it does matter what tool you use.
Luz: [yells and flinches as she almost gets hit with the knife]

Luz: [outside] And three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and eight, and nine, and ten!
Luz: Alright, King. What's the first thing you're going to do when you meet your dad?
Luz: Have you told Eda about your decision to le--?
Luz: It's okay, buddy. Hey Eda, got another backpack I can borrow? This one got a little thrown-up in.
Luz: Oh, no, I'm still going home, but I keep running into some setbacks.
Luz: Come on, little buddy. You got portal info that I need.
Luz: You want a carrot? Does baby like carrots?
Luz: Here we go. It's okay. See, you're safe here.
Luz: I was able to get the mouse back safely, but he needs to recover.
Luz: Hexside, Glandus, and St. Epiderm students race to win glory, honor, and--
Luz: We are going to enter the competition and get King on camera to send a message to his dad!
Luz: Wanna head back out while your tummy's empty?
Luz: Let's go! [laughs joyfully as she and King exit the house]
Luz and King: [grunting and panting.] Whew!
Luz: All right, King, the Gland Prix is the day after tomorrow. Are you ready?
Luz: Don't worry. She's just been busy this week.
Luz: Eda, King's still waiting to talk to you.
Luz: O-Okay. Well, maybe at the Gland Prix?
Luz: Eda! I'm so glad you made it!
Luz: [covered in leaves and branches] Hey, Eda.
Luz: We were winning for a while, but-
Luz: King, try to hold it in.
Luz: King!
Luz: And then we crashed.
Luz: [pulls out a pen] And, if you sign here, it be official.
Luz: Eda, are you ok? Eda, if you keep doing that, I'm gonna cry too!

Luz: Come on! Work this time. [replicates plant glyph, activates it, gasps when a flower successfully grows] YES! Check it out, King: my glyph skills are blossoming!
Luz: Ah. I see we're getting enough Wi-Fi through the portal for cat videos.
Luz: I regret teaching you about the Internet.
Luz: Yep, that's not right.
Luz: [gulps]
Luz: Good enough.
Luz: [muffled] Ugh! What am I supposed to say? [sits up; normal] "Hey mom, not at camp actually! I'm in the demon realm learning to be a witch! Also, did you know that demons and magic are real?" She. Will. End me.
Luz: Hm. The demon on my shoulder makes a good point.
Luz: Hehe. [finger guns her friends; kisses King's head] Don't spend all day watching MewTube, 'kay?
Luz: Something's different today. Did everyone get a haircut?
Luz: [gasps] You guys have a version of prom on the Boiling Isles? I was kicked out of my last school dance for dressing like an otter, but here, I can be your Grom queen!
Luz: No problem, let me help you!
Luz: Here, your note.
Luz: Man, you got some quick grabbers.
Willow, Luz, and Gus: [gasp]
Luz: WHOOOO! Amity, get it, queen!
Luz: Don't leave me hangin'!
Luz: Ah. My first school dance experience on the Boiling Isles. I can't wait to get overdressed, take awkward photos, push all the buttons- wait, what?
Luz: Well, hello. Don't mind if I do.
Luz: Woah!
Luz: [gasps] Medieval torture seems like a strange theme for Grom, but hey--
Luz: Right. Why don't you seem excited?
Luz: If it worries you so much, then why don't you tell Principal Bump you want out of this death match biz? [gasp] Unless talking to Bump is your greatest fear.
Luz: Hm.
Luz: [offscreen] I'm home!
Luz: Guys?
Luz: Hey, sweet duds, owl lady! What's the haps? [sits on Eda's nest]
Luz: Yeah. It's Amity. She's kinda freaking out though. I wish I could, like, take her place or something.
Luz: Hey! I've been learning lots of new spells! I could totally handle it.
Luz: Nope. I'm not as fragile as you think, Eda. And I can't be so easily fooled, either.
Luz: "Fragile". Eda doesn't know me! I-I'm brave! I'm a bad boy!
Luz: Ominous footsteps, creepy woods. This is no problem.
Luz: LUZ CHOP! AAAAAAHHHHHH!
Luz: [gasp]
Luz: Oh my gosh, Amity! I'm so sorry!
Luz: Did you talk to Bump? Was it as terrifying as you imagined?
Luz: I would.
Luz: [stands] Amity Blight, I'll do it. I'll take your place and face Grom in the arena. I'll be your fearless champion!
Luz: [weakly] fearless... champion..
Luz: Hmmm....
Luz: Hmm!
Luz: [tries to hit him] Hooty! No touching!
Luz: Amity!
Luz: [picks up outfits] Which should I wear to Grom? [holds up black dress] This one says, "witch with a dark side." [holds up otter suit, puts on matching smile] But this one says, "I'm an otter... with a dark side."
Luz: Stop, stop! Amity, Amity, wai-- AMITY, STOP!"
Luz: In preparation, I've made a list!
Luz: [yelps] Jerks online who wanna debate!
Luz: AH!
Luz: Human souls trapped in cat bodies!
Luz: NOOOO! I'm lactose intolerant!
Luz: My real fear... is that Eda thinks I'm too fragile to do this! And if she's right, I'll never be a real witch!
Luz: [offscreen] Nooooo!
Luz: So what if I am! [falls, yelps]
Luz: Well, maybe you'll have fun watching me defeat Grom!
Luz: I'll take it!
Luz: I'm not sure if it's nerves or if I accidentally drank some milk, but something's making my stomach squirm.
Luz: Hah! Yeah right! You goin' soft on me, Blight?
Luz: [to Amity] Wish me luck!
Luz: There you are, Gromarama. Not too scary.
Luz: Ugh, so weird.
Luz: You're not coming from a place of intellectual honesty, so debating you would be pointless!
Luz: LET'S FINISH THIS! Human-style!
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Mom! What are you doing here?
Luz: Ah! [drops the flail] I can explain!
Luz: I can't do it! I can't face my fear!
Luz: I don't wanna be Grom queen anymore! I give up the throne!
Luz: [yells]
Luz: You're not really my mom! [turns away]
Luz: Eda! You're right! I'm not ready!
Luz: Amity! No, your fear!
Luz: Who is that?
Luz: [gasps] You were afraid of getting rejected. Amity, it's okay. What if I went to Grom with you instead?
Luz: That's what friends do.
Luz: Sooooooo.... who did you wanna ask out?
Luz: Thanks, but... I'm gonna go to bed.
Luz: In the end, I couldn't face my mom. Maybe I am fragile.
Luz: Hmm.
Luz: [narrating] I won't lie. Today was kinda hard.
Luz: [narrating] And I don't always feel like I'm supposed to be here.
Luz: [narrating] But when things get tough, my friends help me out.
Luz: [narrating] I think you'd like them.
Luz: [narrating] Te extraño también, Mami. One day, I'll tell you all about this.
[The wind howls, blowing clouds away from the moon. Luz looks out on the sea and smiles. She receives another text from her mom. It reads: "can't wait! P.S. love receiving your letters!"]
Luz: Aw. That's a cute way of saying "text".

Luz: [visibly nervous] What if he gets hurt? What if the kids are mean to him? [gasps] My parental instincts are freaking out, man.
Luz: It does look like he's having fun.
Luz: Aw. I wonder what cute little game he's playing.
Luz: Aw, what a sweetie. How did you get him?
Luz: Hey, what's that? [points to Owlbert's foot]
Luz: [echoing] Eda?
Luz: Eda! Eda! Wake up!
Luz: Are you all right? [helps Eda up]
Luz: King we have to go!
Luz: King!
Luz: I'll go get your elixir.
Luz: Do you need me to stay home and take care of you? [gasps] I could put King in a little doctor's outfit.
Luz: I do.
Luz: So, how'd you get it?
Luz: You don't know?
Luz: Well, Willow, Gus, and I are going to the Grudgby game between Hexside and Glandus High.
Luz: Since I found a little something called "Hexside Pride." [grunts] To think that Glandus, whoever they are, would dare face us. But if you need me to stay...
Luz: Hooray! Hooray for sport! Hugs and kisses, King. [kisses his skull] Mwah! [sing-song] Don't spend all night plotting revenge.
Luz: Hexside's gonna wreck your side. [stops walking] Huh, no. [keeps walking] Hexside is the best side in the west side. [yelps]
Luz: [shudders] Ah! Friends.
Willow and Luz: Whoo‐hoo!
Luz: Happy game day, fellow, uh... Are we Hexidians? Hexies? [gasps] Hexoleos?
Luz: [looks at her hoodie] Is it weird that I'm not wearing anything Hexside?
Luz: Hey! I'm a Hexside nerd. Gotta change out of this shirt. Where can I get a Hexside one?
Luz: Ah! The lost and found. Where mouthguards go to retire.
Luz: Yes!
Luz: Goooo, Hexside! [does a split] Well, I never did that before. Uh, where is everyone?
Luz: Oh, no! Come back! Why didn't you guys board the bus?
Luz: Can we walk to Glandus?
Luz: [scoffs] Typical Glandus.
Luz: A staff... because staffs fly. Of course. I can get us a staff.
Luz: Yes, come on.
Luz: [offscreen] King, are you home?
Luz: Is Eda up?
Luz: Oh, no. I wanted to ask if I could borrow her staff but I know she needs her rest.
Luz: I can't. Not without Eda's permission.
Luz: I really owe Gus and Willow one. And it's just for the afternoon. I'm sure Eda wouldn't mind.
Luz: [starts to leave] I'll be back soon.
Luz: [stops leaving] What?
Luz: Oh, okay. [leaves for real]
Luz: To Glandus High.
Luz: Oh! Sorry, Owlbert. It's okay. We're just on our way to help some friends.
Luz: Who's ready to board Air Luz?
Luz: Next stop, Glandus High. Let's go.
Luz: Step on it, Owlbert.
Luz: [grunts]
Luz: [groans, stands] Is everyone okay? Huh?
Luz: Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no! Owlbert, come back!
Luz: Owlbert!
Luz: He went through those trees. Come on. [starts running]
Luz: This is Eda's palisman, Willow. She'll kill me if we don't get it back. Let's go.
Luz: Those are bones, Willow.
Luz: This isn't any kind of forest I'm used to. [pokes a spiderweb with the staff]
Luz: Hey, I remember you. You're Bat Queen's babies.
Luz: [walks towards the bats] Uh, we're looking for a little owl and... There he is.
Luz: Owlbert, thank goodness you're okay. Come here, buddy. Time to go home.
Luz: Bat Queen. I know. We kinda babysat her kids once. Don't worry. I got this. [to Bat Queen] Hiya, BQ. My, your hair is looking greasy. And your kids [chuckles] they're as hideous as ever.
Luz: [chuckles] So... Owlbert ran away and I need to get him back. I'm just gonna grab him and we'll be on our way.
Luz: Ah!
Luz: And thank you for that, uh, but he belongs to Eda, the Owl Lady. [removes Bat Queen's claw] And you owe her a favor, remember?
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Owlbert, I never meant to hurt you. [kneels down] Please trust me.
Luz: But I have to get Owlbert back. I accept your challenge.
Luz: [grunts, looks at Owlbert]
Luz: All right. Come here, pal. Let's do this.
Luz: If you run, you'll just make this harder for yourself.
Luz: [yelps]
Luz: [grunts]
Luz: No, I was selfish,
Luz: and I hurt Owlbert. I need to do this alone so he knows I care about him. [dumps barrel of water over the baby bats]
Luz: Aw!
Luz: [screams]
Luz: Okay, Bat Queen. That's the last one. I've done all your chores. And I've proved my dedication to Owlbert. I'm so sorry for the pain I caused you, Owlbert. I promise to be more careful. Will you come back home with me?
Luz: What?
Luz: [yelping, runs]
Luz: [grunts]
Luz: [yelps]
Luz: I won't let you imprison Owlbert.
Luz: [grunting, trips]
Luz: [gasps, grunts]
Luz: [gasps] Is that an interlock? [kicks the staff and Bat Queen away] Bat Queen, you used to be on a staff, didn't you? You were a Palisman.
Luz: You were once a Palisman, weren't you?
Luz: So, that's why you're so protective of Owlbert.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: I understand. But Owlbert is not forgotten. He has someone at home who loves him very much.
Luz: That's not your decision to make.
Luz: [gasps, braces for attack]
Luz: Bat Queen, do you know what happened to your owner?
Luz: If you ever want to search for the truth, I'll help you.
Luz: Thank you for helping me get Owlbert back. I'm sorry we missed the game.
Luz: [chuckles] Let's get this little guy home.
Luz: And now you're a part of the boo‐boo buddy club.
Luz: [gulps]
Luz: [to Owlbert] We'll keep this one to ourselves, shall we?

Luz: [speaks while activating glyphs] Light in the darkness, a glittering bridge of ice, the mightiest tree in the forest! You can make all these, and more, with glyph magic! Welcome to day 3 of Luz's magic boot camp!
Luz: Okay, we have covered every glyph I've learned up until now. So today, we'll learn something new.
Luz: Un... fortunately no. These 4 either came from nature or another witch's spell. I- I don't know where to find more.
Luz: In any case, today we're learning how to alter glyphs to do specific things!
Luz: Yeah! That's really good! [Lilith fist pumps.] Let's see how you're doing Eda.
Luz: I- I don't think that's such a good-
Luz: I know you're impatient to get your powers back, but try to master the basics before you start experimenting.
Luz: Uh okay, uh, King's in charge while I'm gone. Bye!
Luz: Okay, first day back after the petrification ceremony. Just be chill.
Luz: [tears up] Oh my gosh!
Luz: [notices her friend is taller] Whoa, Gus! Did I uh, miss a birthday or something?
Luz: I can't thank you guys enough for helping me and Eda at the conformatorium.
Luz: Amity!
Luz: Oh wow! That sounds so-
Luz: [disgusted expression] ...Gooood...
Luz: Thank you. [takes the pie] You know, after everything that's happened, I'm just happy to return to some sense of normalcy.
Luz and Gus: What?!
Luz: No! But us... Good... Amity, tell them!
Luz: No wait, no! Amity! Amity!
Luz: Hey!
Luz: How dare you mess with my friends' lives! What have we ever done to you?
Luz: How does this teach anything? We're still gonna be friends with her. I'm calling applesauce on this business baloney!
Luz: Operation Change Bump's Mind. Let's go!
Luz: Don't worry guys, as long as we stick together we'll think of something!
Luz: Hey, I get it. You're scared of her, but I'm not, and I need you to take me her. She seemed open to talking things through.
Luz: Yes, I do. Willow and Gus don't deserve this. [picks up Amity's book] So, will you help me, please?
Luz: Hello Mrs. Blight, I-
Luz: Ooh.
Luz: Ooh, this place smells a lot better than the Owl House.
Luz: And...! [turns the abomination butler's face into a kitty face, but it melts immediately]
Luz: [laughs] Well, I tried. [opens door and walks down the basement] Hello? Mr. and Mrs. Blight?
Luz: Eek!
Luz: I'm here to appeal to your hearts, Blights!
Luz: Like, abominations?
Luz: I get it. I'll help you show off your weird abomination gunk if you promise to let me and my friends back into school.
Luz: So, Alador, what would you say is the specialty of Blight Industries?
Luz: Oh, that sounds pretty safe!
Luz: Huh? [a lump of clay hits her, pinning her to the wall] Whoa!
Luz: [pants] Ah! [ducks attack] Whoa! [ducks attack again]
Luz: [sigh of relief] Oh my goodness, only one more to go.
Luz: [laughs nervously] You're a big boy, aren't ya?
Luz: Okay! It's super strong! I think the crowd gets it!
Luz: Okay, at least you can't get me up here...
Luz: Luz, you fool!
Luz: Ah! [lands] Hey! I'm alive!
Luz: Oh, no.
Luz: I'm dead! [closes her eyes, waiting for inevitable death, but something stops the Abomaton] Huh?
Luz: [looks at Amity with a surprised expression] Amity?
Luz: [looks at Amity with an amazed expression, blushing] Uh-huh. [gasps] Look out!
Luz: [whispers] Can you actually do that?
Luz: Hey guys! [wipes off abomination gunk of her hair]
Luz: Sorry, can it wait 'till morning? [tired expression] I need to lie down.
Luz: [amused] Oh, my gosh!
Luz: [amazed] Wow! Yeah! Extra credit for everyone!

Luz: Oh boy, cards! The paper rectangles that old people think are fun!
Luz: Uh, Eda? It's happening again!
Luz: Uh, last time this happened, you turned into this thing. [holds up her phone, a picture of the Owl Beast on screen]
Luz: Eda!
Luz: Market! [stands and starts to leave]
Luz: [handing the deck to Owlbert] Take these and fly ahead. She'll have to follow us.
Luz: Is there anything better than people watching in the Demon Realm?
Luz: The curse of tiny legs.
Luz: Whoa, that is one ominous parade.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Willow and Gus! [runs up to them] Heya, friends! Wait, what's wrong? Who hurt my babies?
Luz: "It's conjuring night! No dorks allowed"? What a jerk! [scowls for a second] What's a moonlight conjuring?
Luz: Like a slumber party! We have those!
Luz: [pauses] Like a weird slumber party!
Luz: I'm three people-- I mean, we're three people, and we're way better than them!
Luz: Whoa. [slaps the tallest vine, hugs Willow] Don't waste your time getting thorny over them. 'Cause we're gonna have our own moonlight conjuring.
Luz: That's a really weird thing to want, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'll go tell Eda.
Luz: Eda, Gus and Willow and I are gonna do a moonlight conjuring and stick it to Amity. So can we--
Luz: Then, maybe they can come to the house and--
Luz: But--
Luz: So...guys...
Luz: Uhm...yes. She said yes. We can do it at the Owl House. As long as we don't make a mess or touch anything and never bring up that we did it! [nervous laugh]
Luz: You can count on me; I'd never betray your hard-earned trust. [nervous laugh]
Luz: [now has her hood up and closed] Meow I'm not. Uh... [pushes hood down] Oh, where's King?
Luz: Aww, he's so dangly. [plays with his feet]
Luz: Ay. Should I really be doing this? No, no, Willow is counting on you. [whispering] Okay, she's gone.
Luz: Welcome to, the living room. We call it that because it's technically living! The walls are breathing, look.
Luz: We've got snacks, we've got weird music!
Luz: Gus, my man.
Luz: So how does this conjuring stuff work?
Luz: Yes! He's perfect!
Luz: Yes! [hugs Willow]
Luz: Moonlight tie... string... and I don't know the words!
Luz: Guys? [a book falls on her head] Did the entire house just hiccup?
Luz: The house?
Luz: [running up to the door] Hooty? Hooty! Hooty, you have to stop!
Willow and Luz: Gus!
Luz: Hooty, stop!
Luz: Willow, Gus, hold hands again.
Luz: On the one hand, we should probably stay put.
Luz: Okay, okay, but we gotta be back before the moon sets or Eda will kill me.
Gus and Luz: Yeah! Joyride!
Luz: Hmm. [to Boscha through a megaphone] Hey. H‐Hey you. You should, uh, stop being so mean to people. You're kind of a jerk.
Luz: But don't you see? I am no mere house.
Luz: Actually, I'm starting to think we should head back.
Luz: "Shout out to my fellow witches. #Humans can bite it." [gasps] Let's do it.
Luz: Is that a... giant crossbow?
Luz: Hooty! Hooty! You have to wake up!
Luz: ¡Oye, no me hable así! Willow, will you help me out with Hooty?
Luz: Willow.
Luz: Did the house stop moving?
Luz: No! Hooty would taste terrible.
Luz: If we're not killed now, we will be when Eda finds out about the house.
Luz: Whaaat?
Luz: That's ridiculous. You helped bring a house to life. Amity doesn't know what she's talking about.
Luz: Next to Eda, you're the most powerful witch I know. No offense, Gus.
Luz: Everyone, quick!
Luz: Oh, no. I don't mean to step on this victory but we gotta get home before Eda does.
Luz: [waving out the window] Sorry, mister.
Luz: Did we do it?
Luz: Sorry about all that, Hooty.
Luz: Oh, boy.
Luz: Oh, man.
Luz: I did.
Luz: Yes.
Luz: [to Willow] Hey, you didn't have to do that.
Luz: [to Willow] You know, I still kinda wish we got to show up Amity.

Luz: Oh, little echo mouse. You ate the diary that can get me home. Can't you cough up a teeny bit?
Luz: Hmm. Maybe I just need to be patient? [presses her face on the glass and whispers] Please tell me your secrets.
Luz: Come on, Eda. We gotta fly!
Luz: Hey, Willow. Shouldn't Amity be here?
Luz: Oh. [chuckles] That actually makes sense. [looks down, saddened]
Luz: Holy Titan!
Luz: They're so cute!
Luz: Aw. Little rascal!
Luz: I want to be a witch! [none of the Palismen approach her] Uh... probably just takes a little longer 'cause I'm a human, right?
Luz: That's impossible. I'm Luz, I'm chock full of conviction!
Luz: Oh, uh... get home to my mom?
Luz: Huh, I guess I never thought that far ahead.
Luz: I stayed here because I wanted to learn magic, right? I wanted to be a witch like Eda and Azura. But what does that even mean? And I read stories like this. The main character always has to return home, and what? Did I expect to be a witch back in Connecticut? [groans] Mmm. Yeah, I wouldn't want to be my palisman either.
Luz: It's you! Did you come here for me?
Luz: No. Of course not. Come on, little dude.
Luz: How are we supposed to get through this?
Luz: Ooh, palismen powers. Neat!
Luz: Aw. [closes the door] All right. I'm not leaving here until I figure out what my future is, and one of you becomes my palismen! What if... I use my powers to become a popular magician back in the human realm? No, I'm horrible at card tricks. What if... [picks up the cardinal palisman] I stay on the Boiling Isles, and become a rugged bounty hunter? Nah, I'm too lovable. Oh! If I go back...
Luz: [sleepily] What if... I open a magic pet shop, but it's password protected. The password is, "You're a little angel."
Luz: Hey, we're a little busy in... here?
Luz: [to the palismen] I think we're being kidnapped!
Luz: Don't worry. I'll figure this out.
Luz: Ugh, him again.
Luz: Hi-yah!
Luz: He'll be fine. Okay, how do I land this thing? Huh.
Luz: Thank y--
Luz: Wha- Hey!
Luz: Why are you stealing palismen, Golden Guard?
Luz: [scoffs] Whatever. I broke out of there like twice.
Luz: Say, how did you get back on the ship so fast?
Luz: Cool.
Luz: What is that?
Luz: Huh? Little rascal?
Luz: Oh, thank you. [groans] My head!
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Don't worry. I won't leave him.
Luz: This is the Golden Guard?
Luz: It looks like he could be a student at Hexside.
Luz: Wake up!
Luz: Shh! [puts hand over the Golden Guard's mouth to silence him] Listen. You are a bad person, and I do not like you. But Kikimora is trying to kill you and unfortunately, I'm too nice to let that happen!
Luz: Ugh, are you licking my hand? [puts her saliva covered hand in his face] I'm trying to help you!
Luz: Because... [grunts]
Luz: Whew, man, Kikimora must hate you. Whoa! I haven't been outside Bonesborough that much, Latissa is so cool! Wait! Where are you going? Hey man, I just saved your life, the least you could do is tell me your name.
Luz: Hmm?
Luz: Uh, excuse me. Sorry.
Luz: Sorry.
Luz: Ice glyph!
Luz: Come on, Golden Guard. Don't you know any, like, levitation spells?
Luz: [points at his staff] Are you powerless without this?
Luz: Back up, or--or else!
Luz: Seems like neither of us want her to win right now. So, let's work together to take back those palismen.
Luz: Maybe you won't have a choice! [spins the Golden Guard's staff around] I'm more formidable than you think. [almost drops it over the edge, but catches it]
Luz: [extends her hand] Truce!
Luz: Too slow. [runs off chuckling]
Luz: Well, we don't want to spook Kikimora's steed, because it might drop the nest and hurt the palismen! So, using these fire and ice spells, I can command the glyphs to produce a thick mist!
Luz: They're essential! Combined with the magic mist, it'll create-
Luz: -A Study of Wild Magic! Eda once pickpocketed the guy who wrote it.
Luz: Really?
Luz: Uh huh... Other than Lilith, I've never spoken to someone inside the Emperor's Coven. What made you want to join?
Luz: At least you have your future figured out now.
Luz: He's just being friendly.
Luz: And does he look dangerous to you?
Luz: Masks on.
Luz: Once they're surrounded by the smoke, we'll need to stay close to see where they land.
Luz: Just take it!
Luz: The palismen!
Luz: Hello, babies. Aw, you guys must be so cold and scared. Here, [takes off her cap] make sure you share. Now, stay in here, okay? We'll get you home safe and-
Luz: [nervous chuckle] Right, I didn't think this through. Again.
Luz: So you're really gonna do this? You're just gonna hand all these innocent little guys over to Belos? I know what he does with them. I thought you might've been a good guy. But I guess that was just wishful thinking. You're not my friend, you're just the Golden Guard.
Luz: Hey... [chuckles] ...good thingy. The Boiling Isles will never stop surprising me.
Luz: [sighs] Everyone got one except me, huh? Maybe I wasn't meant to be here. [she turns her head only to turn it back when light shines from her window finding...] Eda!
Luz: What did you get into?
Luz: [confused] Whew. Uh, how... thoughtful?
Luz: But-- But how? Isn't this super rare?
Luz: I don't know what to say...
Luz: If it's okay, I'd like some time to think. It's hard to picture my future without seeing my mom.
Luz: [smiles] Thanks.

Luz: [shaking her head] I don't like this. [She plugs her nose.]
Luz: Please don't make me.
Luz: So, Eda...
Luz: What if we tried some new lessons for my apprenticeship? Like...
Luz: Read ancient scrolls or mix together potions, or‐
Luz: Wait. Is there a magic school here? Like, winding towers, cute uniforms, dark plots that threaten your life kind of magic school?
Luz: Oh, hey. Greasy slime ball.
Luz: Actually, if it's okay, [starts backing away] I think I'll head home and look at pictures of animals that are still... alive. Love you, King. [pets his belly]
Luz: You little beach peach. [continues walking into the woods]
Luz: Ugh! If magic's all about digging for slime balls, maybe I don't have the stomach for it. [pockets the slime ball]
Luz: [looks around] Mysterious voice of encouragement? [looks through bushes and gasps] No! Little witch girl.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Witch drama!
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: [screams]
Luz: [rubs her leg] It's okay. The thorns only went through a few layers of skin.
Luz: [squeals and covers her ears]
Luz: [half-waves back, then rushes after her] Wait! I'm Luz. And you're Willow, right? What you did with that flower and those plants, it was... wow.
Luz: [squeals, grabbing Willow] Like, magic school?
Luz: That's so cool! [lets Willow go] I'm so jealous. I have a teacher, but her lessons are a bit... untraditional. I bet she wouldn't even let me enroll. But I wish I could spend one day there.
Luz: Hey, wait. I know how we can both get what we want. [picks up abomination goo in both hands and splashes it on her hoodie] Make me your abomination. I'll get you a good grade, and you can get me into magic school. It's fiendishly clever.
Luz: I saw that girl's thing. It's just chunks of stuff that talks weird. I'm chunks of stuff, and I talk weird!
Luz: This is a great plan.
Luz: Great plan.
Luz: Actually, it's for storing treats.
Luz: [stands out of the pot] Ta‐da! I'm an abomination.
Luz: I knew an Augustus back in the human world. We called him Gus.
Luz: [hisses as she sinks down]
Luz: [peeks out of the pot] Don't listen to them, Willow. We can do this.
Luz: [punches the lid off and jumps out] Ta‐da!
Luz: [grunts] Blah!
Luz: Uh, I may be your abomination, but you're my a‐mom‐ination.
Luz: Oh my gosh I haven't eaten real food in so long please give me some.
Luz: [groans as her head falls back]
Luz: Whoo! I'm a sweaty little abomination. But now we don't have to worry about Amity. High five!
Luz: [demonstrating] Slap my hand. It's a human thing.
Luz: Uh, viral fame is a worthy pursuit. Your cat would never eat you if it got the chance. Chemtrails are real‐‐
Luz: [whimpers as she goes to lie down on it]
Luz: [shakes her head]
Luz: This is all my fault, Willow. I just wanted to see what a real magic school was like.
Luz: It's lovely, actually.
Luz: You're Full‐Witch Willow. And you're great. And someone once told me great witches are resourceful. [pulls out the contents of her pockets.]
Luz: You mean that greasy slime ball?
Luz: Yeah. Thank goodness someone told me to hold on to it.
Luz: There's the exit!
Luz: Whoa!
Luz: No! I'm not leaving you.
Luz: Willow! [sighs] I can't save you right now. But I know someone who can! [runs off]
Luz: [running toward them] Eda!
Luz: Your lesson worked! Keeping junk in my pocket saved my life! [gasps] But wait. My new friends. They're in danger.
Luz: It's true. I don't believe it.
Luz: [hugs Willow again] Yes!
Luz: Whoo! Oh. What about Amity?
Luz: Well, I can't wait to see you in action next time I sneak in. [Behind her, Willow winces.]
Luz: Aw. That would be nice. But... I have a pretty great teacher already.

Luz: [gets up] None. And I was up all night. I read every tome, book, notepad, and tea leaf. [shows Eda a cup, with the tea leaf forming into a shrugging person] But nothing explains how to make a portal to the Human Realm.
Luz: How long did you have it?
Luz: [claps hand] Ooh!
Luz: Why wouldn't you tell anyone?
Luz: [serious expression] Always. Always curious.
Luz: Hide from who?
Luz: [surprised] Magic bird tornado?
Luz and Lilith: [shocked] Mom?!
Luz and Lilith: What?!
Luz: I'd kill to see my mom right now, and you just launch yours into the sky?!
Luz: [from a distance] Mrs. Clawthorne?
Luz: Wait! [runs up to Gwendolyn] I'm Luz. Eda's apprentice. I think what you're doing is so sweet. Eda can just be so... Eda sometimes.
Luz: I understand. Right now, there's an actual rift between me and my mom in the Human Realm.
Luz: [excited] Really?
Luz: [exhilarated] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Where do we start?
Luz: So we're gonna meet a curse expert? This is so rad.
Luz: Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's always down for more apple blood. So, [stands up] that Wortlop guy was really something. You're his pupil?
Luz: [amazed] Cool. Also, dang, girl, [compares her bicep to Gwendolyn’s] your bicep game is ridiculous.
Luz: [gasps] She's stressed.
Luz: Oh. [stares down at the elixir with a worried expression]
Luz: [smiles] All right. What do we do next?
Luz: Gwen, [turns to Gwendolyn] we tried freezing the curse out, we tried sweating the curse out, we even tried [shrugs] flying snakes for some reason.
Luz: I don't think this stuff is working. Did Wortlop ever say where he learned this stuff? [looks to Gwendolyn]
Luz: [squints] What did you just do?
Luz: [dubious] Let me see that book. [walks towards Gwendolyn]
Luz: [flips open book] What is this? Jar of bees for existential dread? Aromatherapy for broken legs? Bird songs for sufferers of stuffy noses?! [turns towards Gwendolyn] Gwen, you're being scammed! Wortlop is a fake.
Luz: I know you want what's best for Eda, and so do I. [takes out an elixir from her waist pouch] But I'm calling this off. [walks off and kneels down on one leg]
Luz: [angrily] Are you kidding me?! You just... [pinches her eyebrows] Argh, whatever. I'll just get more at the house.
Luz: Whoa. [stands up angrily] Why would you do that?
Luz: Eda, please try to stay calm.
Luz: Have to what?
Luz: King?!
Luz: We have to help them. Will you [reaches out her hand] come with me?
Luz: [closes her eyes] I can see you still need a little time. [opens eyes] Alright, Owlbert. [Owlbert hoots] Let's fly!
Luz: [anxiously] Gotta think fast. [notices something ahead] Whoo!
Luz: [from a distance] Morton!
Luz: I need every last elixir you have.
Luz: Also, do you accept [takes out a drawing of Morton from her pocket] payment in hyper-realistic pencil portraits? [grins at Morton]
Luz: Shoot! I thought I was improving. [looks down at the drawing sadly]
Luz: You sure this is gonna work? [glances over at Gwendolyn]
Luz: [impressed] Dang, that is good elixir.
Luz: What?
Luz: Someday my hair is gonna be big enough to do that too. [looks at Gwendolyn admiringly]
Luz: [hopefully] Maybe I could find out how he got here!
Luz: [puts her hand over her heart and looks up to the sky] I'll be home soon, Mom.
Luz: [looks down sadly] Camp's probably ended [looks back up to sky] by now.
Luz: She must be so worried.
“Luz”: Here, Mama.

Luz: Can you please be quiet?! You’re scaring the echo mouse. And if he’s not happy, I’ll never make my way into Amity's heart. [realizes what she just said, a flush spreads across her face] I mean make a portal back home. Uh! We have to go!
Luz: [offscreen] You’re scaring the echo mouse. And if he’s not happy, I’ll never make my way into Amity’s heart. [embarrassed] I mean make a portal back home. Uh! We have to go!
Luz: [looks in the terrarium] Okay, little mouse. If you don’t want to tell me about Philip or how he made his portal, maybe you can tell me how to ask out a cotton-candy haired goddess?
Luz: Amity’s smart, cool, and classy. Asking her out should be breathtaking! Emotional! And real! Everyone back home said I was cheesy. Can’t let Amity think the same!
Luz: [reading] As we stumble through life, gloom knows no bounds. You’ll only find love… when you’re in the ground?! Ugh.
Luz: P.S. I mean the basement. [shouts] Hooty, I don’t have time for this! [confused] Also, we have a basement?
Luz: [shocked] Amity?!
Luz: [relieved] Oh yeah, that’s silly, why would Amity be in our-
Luz: [horrified] AMITY?!
Luz: [flustered] Uh, well, this is our basement. I am so sorry about this. [helps Amity up] Hooty’s been acting weird all day.
Luz: Hey! Uh! All I care about is getting you out of our dirty weird basement!
Luz: [quietly] Oh, no.
Luz: [reading] To return to the world above, make your way through the tunnel of- [gasp]
Luz: [quietly] If Amity sees this, she’ll think I’m such a loser!
Luz and Amity: Whoa! Ugh!
Luz: [takes a deep breath] HOOTY!
Luz: [anxious] Oh no. I’m gonna be made fun of again.
[Before Luz can answer, she sees another display: two bees surrounding a heart saying "Amity bee mine".]
Luz: NO! [tears down the display, gets up holding an antenna] That was- uh- an invasive species.
Luz: [deflects the arrows with the antenna] I’m so sorry, Amity! This is not supposed to happen!
Luz: [panting] This… was a nightmare.
Luz: Amity, wait! This wasn’t me, this was all Hooty’s stupid idea!
Luz: I don’t know, but things always get weird when Hooty’s upset.
Luz and Amity: Whoa!
Luz: Whoa. Not as okay as you! Dang girl! I have a few questions for later.
Luz: [whispering] He was trying to help me ask Amity out.
Luz: [shyly] Mm-hmm.
Luz: Like this?! [gestures to Hooty, now rolling on the ground]
Luz: Amity?
Luz: Oh my gosh, Amity, are you okay?
Luz: I was just… I’ve been wanting to ask you something for a while. But I wanted to do it in the best way! And in the tunnel of love, I thought: “Amity’s too cool for this.” [turns red]
Luz: Okay. Everything is so crazy right now, and I have no idea what my future holds, but it would be so cool if you were in it. So… uh…
Luz: [exhales] Nooo I was so ready…
Luz: [sighs] Okay. Amity Blight, do you wanna go out with me?
Luz: Okay!
Luz: Why is this still so scary?

Luz: " 'Azura,' Hecate began. 'Our paths have crossed only in battle. But today I stand before you seeking an ally.' " [sighs]
Luz: I can't help it. Azura is able to befriend everyone. Even her biggest rival. I wish I had that kind of power.
Luz: Okay. "Suddenly the door swung open."
Luz: Hmm?
Luz: Eda, you got a package. It looks like a gift basket.
Luz: No, not eating that.
Luz: Who's the Bat Queen?
Luz: Our greatest adventure yet! Learning about love and life through a child's eyes.
Luz: [halfway out the door] Well, I better get to the library! Got to go! Bye! [closes the door]
Luz: Huh? Whoa.
Luz: Whoa!
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Huh. That was a crazy night.
Luz: Ooh. What's that?
Luz: I am in a library. I will read a book. [runs off]
Luz: Bloop.
Luz: Wow! [screaming]
Luz: [screams] Sorry!
Luz: This place is amazing.
Luz: [gasps] I've been caught. Pretend to be a book. [poses]
Luz: Wait. [walks forward]
Luz: Amity reading to kids?
Luz: Amity seems so... nice and smiley. [gasps] Maybe I can befriend her like Azura befriended her rival. [grunts and ducks down as the kids leave]
Luz: Amity... [stands and leans on a book, making it fall] Whoop. Reading to kids. Wow. Looks like this sour lemon drop has a hidden sweet center.
Luz: [follows her] Hey, I could help with the kids. We could take turns reading. And do voices. I do the best [robotic tone] monster voice.
Luz: [backs up] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Luz: [groans and bumps her fist against her forehead] So much for befriending rivals.
Luz: Who are you?
Luz: I am?
Luz: [chuckles and blushes]
Luz: I know. But I didn't mean any of it. I thought we were as cool as cucumbers. But we're as sour as pickles.
Luz: Whoo!
Luz: Amity's even madder at me now. I didn't think that was possible.
Luz: Sure.
Luz: Bye. This is great. First I befriend the siblings then I befriend the Amity. [squeals and runs off]
Luz: I just had the best day. Cool teens like me. Call me a library book 'cause they were checking me out.
Luz: Aw, Eda, you look so motherly.
Luz: [walks over] Aw. How can you say that around this cute little baby?
Luz: [recoils] Whoa!
Luz: [putting her messenger bag on] Parenting sure looks rewarding. E‐Enjoy your life lessons. Bye.
Luz: Gotta be cool. [rests her arm on the pillar] Cool? [shakes her head and facepalms] No. [leans against the pillar] Cool. [grunts as she kneels down while throwing a peace sign; groans and drops her head]
Luz: Huh? [falls]
Luz: [nods] Mm‐hmm‐mm‐hmm.
Luz: Wow!
Luz: Standing in a dimly lit lobby. You guys know how to party.
Luz: Whoa.
Luz: Wait. [grabs a book titled "Extinct Birds of the Boiling Isles"] The books are all glowy.
Luz: Nothing happened.
Luz: Ha!
Luz: Ah! [runs]
Luz: [yelps]
Luz: "...the pages he'd mend. But all the while he longed for a friend."
Luz: Aw. Cute little quackster.
Luz: [backing away from them] I don't know.
Luz: [sighs] I can't do it.
Luz: [grunts]
Luz: [grunts] I don't wanna see it.
Luz: Oh, wow. Boiling Isles romance. That's totally lame. I mean, unless you guys are into it?
Luz: Wow! That's a good book.
Luz: Your clubhouse is like my ultimate secret hideaway.
Luz: What? Isn't that taking it a bit too far?
Luz: Hmm. Well, I‐‐ I don't see any diaries in here. [half-heartedly looks around] Nope, nothin'. Let's just leave. Wait, are those... [squeals] Good Witch Azura books one through four! You get these on the Boiling Isles? So majestic. [grabs a book] Is this cover hand‐drawn?
Luz: The diary.
Luz: No. [closes it]
Luz: [hides the diary behind her back] Oh. N‐Nothing. Just a Good Witch Azura 5 where she goes through her Goth phase.
Luz: Huh? No, wait.
Luz: I know Amity can be kind of cold but no one deserves this. These are private thoughts. Let's put it back.
Luz: [grunts]
Luz: [grunts]
Luz: Argh. It's not what it looks like.
Luz: Amity! [starts going after her but stops]
Luz: You're just gonna leave?
Luz: Look, you guys are cool.
Luz: But I need to go talk to Mittens. I mean, Amity.
Luz: [rounding the corner] Amity, wait.
Luz: Please, just listen to me.
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Amity!
Luz: Amity. Huh?
Luz: [holding Amity's diary] Close. [pulls at the robes] Is a drawn okay? I kind of interpreted the descriptions.
Luz: Ah, right. [writing in the diary] The good witch, Luzura, grabs her trusty staff. [a staff rises from the pages and she grabs it] All right, beloved work of children's fiction. Let go of her.
Luz: [chuckles nervously] Not an Azura fan, are you?
Luz: You fiend. You can't rhyme friends with friends.
Luz: Hey! I was trying to save you.
Luz: No, we aren't. Follow my lead. [slams her feet against the book] One.
Luz: Two. Three.
Luz: I don't know. I didn't even think that would work. I was all like "roaaar."
Luz: Me!
Luz: [whimpers as the rest of her limbs are tied down]
Luz: Oh. Third dimension how I've missed you.
Luz: Gulp.
Luz: What an adventure. Thanks for helping clean up.
Luz: Wait. It doesn't make up for reading your diary but would you wanna borrow this? [holds out Azura 5] I noticed you only had up to four.
Luz: Hi, guys. I'm...
Luz: home. [smiles at them]
Luz: Hooty.
Luz: Whoa. You must be Mama.
Luz: Your night looks very successful. Look at all that money you made. And look at this cool whistle that scary woman gave you. [spit drops off the whistle] I'd wash it before you use it.
Luz: I actually got you something from the library.
Luz: Good. Then bad. Then maybe good?
Luz: Ugh. No!

Luz: It's been a little slow around here, but I've got just the thing to attract customers.
Luz: And who doesn't like their name in lights?
Luz: Is it too subtle?
Luz: Hi, Boscha! Hexsidians! See anything you like?
Luz: It's not funny, Boscha.
Luz: [kneels down] Even if I could, it's not worth it. You wouldn't understand how to handle teens like her.
Luz: Yeah, teens can be sour, but I'm a little sweetie. Look what I made you!
Luz: Did I spell something wrong? Or did I spell something right?
Luz: Well, I don't see anyone right now. Maybe you're just being paranoid. You're a powerful witch. Why hide when you can "poof" all your problems away with magic?
Luz: Then why are you screaming like one?
Luz: Hug each other till we pass out? [hugs King]
Luz: We're doing that? That's possible? [grabs a VHS box] This is just like my favorite early 2000s movie! Freaky Fraturday. But maybe we should think about this for a second.
Luz: Ooh!
Luz: [in Eda's body] Did it work? I need a mirror. [runs into the mirror with a grunt, slides down] Found one. Oh, my gosh. It worked! I'm so old... [grabs her ears] and pointy!
Luz: Hot dog! It's me!
Luz: Wait, so that means...
Luz: Well, I've got magic. Eda, don't be too mad when your inventory's gone and the guards are none the wiser.
Luz: Whew! Okay, let's try this again. And strut, strut, strut. [grunts]
Luz: How does Eda wear these all day? [sees the broken lamp] Oh, no. What have my heels done? Wait a second. I'm a ding dang witch!
Luz: Boy, Eda is powerful. [yells as magic comes out of her hand] Not again!
Luz: Okay, let's try this one more time.
Luz: [coughs, gasps] I made magic with my hands! [jumps]
Luz: Zippo swappo. Sold to the savvy shopper.
Luz: Okay, magic hands, let's see what else we can magically magic.
Luz: Step right up and feast your eyes on the marvels of the human realm!
Luz: Was it for laughter? [magics a feather duster to tickle him]
Luz: Thank you! Come again! There's a little something for everyone. Take it from me, Eda, the Boiling Isles' gift to magic.
Luz: That depends. Are you a fan... [reaches into the top hat and pulls out flowers] of magic?
Luz: [looks between them] Gentlemen, whaddya say we forget this whole thing ever happened? Amnesia spell!
Luz: Haven't quite got the hang of this yet.
Luz: Owlbert! This is all a big mistake. [led into an interrogation room] You're gonna laugh when I explain.
Luz: Look, guys, you got the wrong Eda.
Luz: Oh, thank goodness! A familiar face. You're Eda's sister, right? Is it Libby? No. Limby...
Luz: Well, as I was telling the guard, this is just a classic Freaky Fraturday mix‐up.
Luz: Yeah, I think that list goes on for a while.
Luz: I know. I can't just "poof" my problems away.
Luz: Eda wanted to be in the Emperor's Coven?
Luz: The what now?
Luz: Wait, you're making a mistake! [draws a large spell circle] I'm not a danger to anyone! [realizes what she did] Uh‐oh.
Luz: [coughs] Owlbert, come to me!
Luz: Huh? Ah! [grunts as Owlbert hits her face; stands] Sorry, buddy. [frees Owlbert] Eda's life is more complicated than I thought.
Luz: [running] Okay, if I were Eda and Eda is King, where would I be? Ah! This thing's so confusing.
Luz: Eda!
Luz and King: [gasp]
Luz: Go, go, go!
Luz: What weird stuff did you get my body into?
King and Luz: Yep.
Luz: Sorry.
Luz: Eda, I just wanna say that things can be more complicated than you think. But with you guys, it all feels a little less mixed up.
Luz: So, wait. Who is going to clean Hooty? It's getting... dire.
Luz: Maybe if we all work together we could‐‐
Luz: Aw, man.

Luz: When I first got here I thought everything was scary or stinky or both. But I've learned to see the beauty in everything by getting outside and painting in nature.
Luz: Oh, that's just some bushes that looked like a dark, mysterious figure, right?
Luz: That's funny. Wasn't there....? [shakes her head] Anyway, I-- [gasp]
Luz: Sometimes my imagination gets away from me. [sweating] Only paint what you see, Luz.
Luz and King: [turn around and scream]
Luz: And you know, sometimes you can find beauty and grow as an artist from the safety of your own bed. [Starts drawing in a notepad.]

Luz: So they said I couldn't remove my thumb, but look at that! [pretends to remove her thumb] Whoop!
Luz: And they say humans can't do magic.
Luz and King: [laugh]
Luz: Heyo, dough boy, quit loafing around!
Luz and King: [laugh]
Luz: School time! See you guys in class!
Luz: Hey, don't worry. We'll finish our comedy hour when I get home. [kisses King's skull and heads for the door]
Luz: [singsong] Try not to miss me while I'm gone! [closes door]
Luz: Apparently there's an infestation of pixies at Hexside, so school's been canceled.
Luz and King: [laugh]
Luz: A carnival? [takes King off her head] You know, I've been so busy with school lately, what do you say we take this comedy hour on tour? It'll be a Luz and King day!
Luz: [puts an arm around Eda] Let's all three of us go!
Luz and King: To the carnival!
Luz: [now in her usual attire] And smell all the fresh meat! [sniffs as a fly goes up her nose; coughs it out her mouth] Fun!
Luz: Aren't you mad at us for destroying your stand?
Luz: Aww. It's like a regular circus but adorably small!
Luz: [presses her face to the glass] You're my friends now.
Luz: You know what, Eda can pick through my socks all she wants. Because today is all about having a great time with my partner in crime.
Luz and King: [laugh, walk off]
Luz: Now this is my kind of weird! So what do you wanna do first? We could brave the molar coaster, or eat a mysterious blob...
Luz: No, silly. That's a friendship bracelet.
Luz: A weapon of love. [grabs them and puts them together, forming a heart] It's basically a declaration to the whole world that you're the best of friends.
Luz: Or let's just play the games.
Luz and King: [laugh] Games! Games! Games! Games!
Luz: [gasps] Friends!
Luz: Oh my gosh, I didn't think I'd see carniv-y'all here.
Luz: Yes! This mama is ready for trauma.
Luz: Oh, yeah. We're on a very important quest to win a special prize for King.
Luz: What do you think, King? The more the merrier, huh?
Luz: All right. Approval!
Willow, Luz, and Gus: [cheering]
Luz: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Gus, Willow, and Luz: [laugh]
Luz: King!
Luz: Sorry we lost you back there, little dude.
Luz: Food! I'm gonna crab some rotten candy while you guys figure this out. [runs] Bye!
Luz: Wow. I guess they really wanted to ride those bumper carcasses.
Luz: No. There's something I gotta tell you, King. [pauses] I said I'd help you win those friendship bracelets. So win them we shall, okay?
Luz: What was that?
Luz: Ready or not, here we crumb.
Luz: Now, King, before you spend your tickets are you sure you want those friendship bracelets and not this bad boy?
Luz: This guy's a riot.
Luz: Ugh, gross. I'm gonna need a mirror. I'll be right back, King. [leaves]
Luz: Oh. There we go.
Luz: "You made it". Aw. What a supportive sign. Wait a sec.
Luz: Supportive friends!
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Oh, my gosh.
Luz: King...
Luz: What?
Luz: [puts Willow and Gus down] That must've been what did it. Give me the spray bottle, King.
Luz: There's nothing to explain. [tries to take the bottle]
Luz: Shrink my friends?
Luz and King: Uh-oh.
Luz: Why are you doing this?
Luz: Aw. At least he's still my friend.
Luz: That's how friends react.
Luz: We've gotta--
Luz: --find a way out of here!
Luz: King?
Luz: You shrunk the animals too?
Luz: All thanks to you, King. [kneels down] Here. [hands him four cracked pieces of the bracelets] It was all that was left.
Luz: That's very sweet.
Luz: [whisper] And can I tell you a secret? I've been missing you too. [kisses]

Luz: Guys!
Luz: You will not believe what's going on! [poses under a banner] It's a book fair! Where books come to life!
Luz: [screams and kicks it]
Luz: No, wait! [to King] Will you give it a chance? I'll let you ride in my hoodie! [puts her hood up]
Luz: This book fair's got everything! A zine-making workshop, meet and greets, and- what's that? [gasp] A writing competition!? I've always wanted to be a writer.
Luz: Of course I wanna be a witch. But where I'm from that's kinda... impossible. So my runner up dream was to be a writer. [pulls a picture out of her pocket] I've had this about the author picture since I was seven years old. I know my good angle. I'm gonna enter the competition.
Luz: Really? [gasps] We could work together! It'll be perfect! We're best friends, so we'll make the best team!
Luz: Now, let's write down some ideas that we want to see in the story.
Luz: Yeah! [hands him notecards and a crayon] We're brainstorming, every idea is a good idea.
Luz: Aw, is that all you want to see?
Luz: Hmm.
Luz: Romance! Magic! Heartbreak with shimmer tears. And, the main character is, of course, ahhh, Luzura! [holds up a card with a drawing of herself wearing a pointed hat] I know it's kind of cliché, but what's wrong with cliché?
Luz: Now for the easy part.
[Cue montage. King stares at the corkboard, now with "ACT 1", "ACT 2", and "ACT 3" on larger notecards in the middle. Luz puts a giant piece of paper over the acts of a drawing of Luzura and Ruler standing in front of an explosion. King and Luz high-five. Cut to Luz writing the following on a chalkboard: "Step 1: Find Cat. Step 2: Endanger Cat. Step 3: Shave Cat (???). Step 4: Book Complete." King nods. Cut to the chalkboard now hanging up and reading "STORY STRUCTURE" with a circle on it, a line cutting it in half, with the numbers 1-8 on it. King gestures to it several times. Luz draws a face on the circle. They both grin. Cut to the floor littered with paper, most of them scribbled over with red. Luz is typing and King is pacing while reading. A banner above them reads "Luzura's Awakening."]
Luz: I see what you're saying. [stops typing] But in your version, Ruler just destroys everything. I think a little romantic tension could help the scene.
Luz: Don't you dare insult shipping in my presence!
Luz: I'll be back, we'll figure this out, okay writing buddy? [Luz leaves]
Luz: Hey!
Luz: What's up, boss lady?
Luz: Great!
Luz: Okay!
Luz: Well King, it's just you and me for a while. [gasps]
Luz: What have you done?!
Luz: [picks up drawing] Luzura dies?
Luz: King, I know you're trying to help, but I think you're crossing a line.
Luz: If this is how you want to win, maybe you should submit the story on your own. [leaves]
Luz: [sighs]
Luz: But I don't want to be mad at him either.
Luz: Hey King, I didn't wanna be angry at your success. You're my friend. So, congratulations!
Luz: Huh?
Luz: [blushes] Excuse me?
Luz: I'm not writing for you after you made fun of all my ideas!
Luz: [turns to go] Congratulations on all your hard earned success. [leaves]
Luz: [sighs] They got his good angle.
Luz: Uh, can I help you?
Luz: [nervously laughs]
Luz: [gasps] King!
Luz: That snappily dressed lizard trapped me in this shrinking box.
Luz: [screams and falls] You gotta get me out!
Luz: [yelps] That's a toxic mentality that contributes to burnout and unrealistic expectations! King, do something!
Luz: Ah! [backs away from the hole]
Luz and King: [gasp]
Luz: Well, I have my story.
Luz: King, that is why we are in here! Because YOU, can't compromise! [turns around] All I wanted was to write a dumb story with my friend.
Luz: Hey, [puts a hand on King's shoulder] being with you is one of my favorite parts of this dream.
Luz: [yelps] I have a plan. But we need to work together this time.
[A hole opens in the top of the box. Luz holds up her manuscript: Luzura and the Shimminger Tears of Love + Hate. "+ Hate" is added in red while the rest is blue. Piniet takes it and flips through part of it. The box shrinks slightly.]
Luz: Light spell!
Luz: King! The contract!
Luz: King! We're good then?
Luz: Yeah, I'll say.
Luz: Books?
Luz: We hate books. Wow, look at the time!

Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Do not underestimate me, Garlog. For I am the good witch, Luz, hunter of monsters. [Perches the staff on her shoulder like a bazooka] Now eat this sucka-- what?
Luz: You're Garlog? [pulls out his wanted poster, depicting him as being much larger and worth 4,000 snails, compares it to the real thing] This is pathetic.
Luz: King, drop it now. Drop it now!
Luz: [chases after him] Drop it! No! I'm not gonna play right now! King!
Luz: [boops Garlog's nose] Boop! [turns on camera to say hello to her mother, just like the end of the season finale] Hola, Mama! You haven't heard from me in a while. It's been a week and a half since the petrification ceremony. A week and a half since I destroyed the portal home. I had to. Emperor Belos was going to kill Eda if I didn't hand it over. But I couldn't let him use it, so I blew it up with some magic fire... She's not gonna understand any of this. That's okay, Luz. Just keep moving forward. This world is filled with inexplicable magical wonders, like this portal key! I don't know if it contains magic, but I'm gonna study all I can, and find a way back to you. A-And look! [Lifts up her leg to show King holding onto it] I have friends to help me.
Luz: He doesn't mean that. [covers camera]
Luz: [narrating] This is Eda the Owl Lady, the most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles. Or at least she was until her curse overpowered her and weakened her magic. She's doing her best now.
Luz: [narrating] Eda was cursed by her own sister, Lilith. And she spent her entire life looking for a way to undo it. It's still hard for everyone to trust each other, but maybe with time we can all become friends.
Luz: [narrating] Even though Eda gets frustrated, she's found new ways to make up for her lost powers.
Luz: [narrating] Without the portal, Eda has no human garbage to sell. So, we've resorted to working odd jobs to keep food on the table.
Luz: King! Hey, no! King! [drops camera, rushes to get King out of harm's way] This week we're bounty hunters. Next week we could be anything. So, Mom, please don't be scared. I'm growing more and more every day, and I'm gonna do my best to become a full-fledged witch, and get home to you safe and sound. Te quiero, Mama. Te lo prometo, regresaré a casa pronto.
Luz: Wow, the Emperor is really taking over.
Luz: The Golden Guard? Did you know him in the Coven, Lilith?
Luz: [side-hugs Eda] Hey, I know! What we need is a confidence boost. Why don't we take on the biggest bounty we can find? It'll be great! [runs up to a bulliten board labeled "Greg's List" and reads the posters there] Hmm. Lost Cerberus, no. Witch cackling lessons? [chuckles] Uh, but maybe not today. Aha! [takes poster down and shows it off] There's something called a "Selkidomus" ravaging boats up and down the coast. We'll be on a high-seas adventure.
Luz: "The Abominable Cutie Pie"?
Luz: [groans]
Luz: This is awful. Eda wouldn't be in this situation if it weren't for me. Maybe it would be better if I never came here. I can't change the past, but I can still change the future. I'm gonna help Eda and prove that I'm more than just a burden.
Luz: The Selkidomus hunt. I want in.
Luz: I can handle anything.
Luz: When we defeat the Selkidomus and get a boatload of snails, Eda won't have to worry about money for a long time.
Luz: Oh, you don't have to worry about me.
Luz: Hiss.
Luz: [shivers, grunts]
Luz: Thanks, Salty. You make me feel like a real part of the crew.
Luz: She's here!
Luz: I did it!
Luz: The money! We're being robbed.
Luz and thief: The money!
Luz: Eda!
Luz: Why are you robbing our ship? And what happened to your legs?
Luz: And why would we do that?
Luz: "Emperor's ship"?
Luz: Leave Eda alone!
Luz: Fine. I'll do it.
Luz: You heard what he said, Eda. If you and King want to be free... then I have to do this alone.
Luz: What? Stick together? Because you stuck with me, you lost your magic. You almost got turned to stone, and now you can't even afford your apple blood because you're worried about what I need to eat. It's my fault all this happened. That's why I've got to do this alone. I'll make it all up to you, Eda the Owl Lady. I promise.
Luz: Whoa!
Luz: All right, let's do this.
Luz: [gasping] Eda, do you want to learn your first glyph?
Luz: You're gross. Now give me King.
Luz: Yeah. You did great.
Luz: Baby! Awww.
Luz: Gold? Tuna?
Luz: No, Eda! Stop!
Luz: No, no, no, no, no.
Luz: Eda!
Luz: What are we supposed to do with this?
King and Luz: Yay! Me, me, me! I do! Yeah! I'm in!
Luz: Anything but seafood.

Luz: Gus, I'd love to go to school with you, but I don't know how I can. [points to her banned poster] Principal Bump banned me from Hexside.
Luz: Well, I would love to go some day. Better than unpacking boxes in the Eda Coven.
Luz: I don't care about T‐shirts, Eda! I want to learn magic, [gestures to Gus] and they teach that at Hexside!
Luz: [sighs and sits on the couch]
Luz: You mean...
Luz: Oh my gosh. [shakes Gus] Yes, yes, yes!
Luz: Of course I'll be there tomorrow! Gus, this will be great! [jumps on the couch] I get to see the school and save the president.
Luz: Undercover from what?
Luz: Whoa. I love it.
Luz: [sniffs] On the Boiling Isles, new things smell old.
Luz: Oh, a showman. I totally get it. You bring the razzle, [pulls the hood back up] I'll bring the dazzle.
Luz: Bye, friend. Be safe. Make good choices.
Luz: That's new.
Luz: Oh. [trumpets, pulls the hood down] Ta‐da!
Luz: Yeah. I've been doing this for years.
Luz: Wow! Who got the trophy for the most bones?
Luz: Whoa!
Luz: Okay. But next time you have to give me a full tour.
Luz: Ooh. It's the abomination professor. I should introduce myself. Apologize for the incident. Hey, Mr. Abomination Professor. The "abominominator." Remember me? [roars]
Luz: Ooh. What's in here?
Luz: Willow, hey.
Luz: Wait, if you're here, who is that?
Luz: Wow, Gus. You're good.
Luz: Oh! [recovers, takes the hood off]
Luz: Of course, Mr. President. Allow me to determine if they're truly of my realm's origin. [reaches for the "shoe"]
Luz: Hey, man. It's okay. You're only human. Well, you know what I mean.
Luz: We've all been the new kid before. Right, Gus?
Luz: No, it's fine. The ban's been lifted. Tell 'em, Gus. [screams as she's dragged away] Gus! Tell them!
Luz: Help!
Luz: [screams] I don't even learn here!
Luz: Where are you taking me?
Luz: Oh. That won't be so bad, right?
Luz: [screams]
Luz: [hiding behind a rock] Gus! You said the ban was lifted!
Luz: [screams]
Luz: How is this detention? This is a death sentence!
Luz: That isn't hard to believe. You're kind of a jerk.
Luz: Mattholomule! [to Gus] You lied to me. You lied about the ban! Why?
Luz: Yes, you did!
Luz: [puts a hand on his shoulder] I get it. I just wish you told me the truth.
Luz: [yelps] Ya! [kicks it] I'm in. Where do we start?
Luz: [screams]
Luz: [tries to bite the pod] You know, it didn't taste as bad as I thought it would. Oh, you're a witch. Do magic.
Luz: [strains, tosses Mattholomule over her shoulder] Oh, gosh. He's so little.
Luz: This is part of the plan, right?
Luz: A genius and a wordsmith.
Luz: Right behind you. [picks up Mattholomule and follows him]
Luz and Gus: [screaming]
Luz and Gus: [screaming]
Luz and Gus: [panting]
Luz: Eda?
Luz: What?
Luz: [screams]
Luz: [gasps and smiles]
Luz: Yeah! Let's go.
Luz: [to Eda] Wow! Bump was not exaggerating. You were a terrible student.

Luz: I-I'm not ready for this Eda. Maybe we should go back.
Luz: But what if... What if I mess something up? Or what if I do something wrong? [gasps] What if I die?
Luz: Eda!
Luz: Pumped!
Luz: [pulls hood up] Ready!
Luz: [movie trailer narrator voice] From the humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise. [normal voice] I have traveled from another realm and trained with a powerful witch to master dark and forbidden magic. I am... [takes cloak off with a twirl] Luz Noceda!
Luz: [chuckles awkwardly, tosses confetti out of a fanny pack] Confetti!
Luz: I sure can. [zips open fanny pack] It's said that humans can't do magic, [pulls out papers and shows them to both sides of the auditorium] but I discovered a lost technique that changes everything.
Luz: Uhh...
Luz: Um, I can do other things, what about... this? [stands, flips eyelids inside out] Bleep, bloop, bleep!
Luz: Ow ow! Eyelash! Eyelash!
Luz: Sorry, sorry, sorry! [places hand on an ice glyph] Whoops! AH!
Luz: I failed, didn't I?
Luz: [falls on her face]
Luz: [weakly] Hurray.
Luz: Mmm, we gotta go back. This was a mistake! I'm gonna mess things up again and everyone will see, and-
Luz: That's why I'm nervous! At my human school, I didn't make a good first impression. This is a chance to be seen as something other than a screw-up.
Luz: Aw, I won't be doing that. But thanks.
Luz: Nah, I'll just earn it when I quit showering. Bye! [runs off]
Luz: Thanks, Eda. In fact, [pulls sock puppets of her and Eda out of her pockets] I have written a heartfelt sonnet to commemorate this occasion.
Luz holding Puppet Eda: You're gonna do great, kid.
Luz: Thanks, Puppet Eda.
Luz: Thanks, Amity! Up top!
Luz: [wipes mud off her face] Blegh! Wow, my first day at Hexside. A chance to discover my true magical potential. And maybe meet a hot yet vulnerable upperclassman.
Luz: King?
Luz: Why are you in my bag?
Luz: Okay, but if anyone asks, you don't know me. [walks away]
Luz: Hello, fellow Hexoleos!
Luz: Hmm, that's what I'm gonna figure out right now. [goes inside] See you on the other side, friends.
Luz: Hiya, Princy-B! Can I call you that?
Luz: Actually, Principal Bump, I've made my own schedule. [unfurls a scroll] First, Vet Care for Mythical Beasts, then Healing and Dealing, and then after lunch-
Luz: Then I'll be the first.
Luz: But all the tracks are so cool! Is there some sort of enchanted article of clothing that could sort this out for me?
Luz: I don't know if I can choose just one.
Luz: Oh, I guess I have always liked pouring things into other things.
Luz: See, potions are fun! [pours test tube into cauldron] You could spend the rest of your life studying this, right?
Luz: The Oracle Track!
Luz: The Plant Track!
Luz: [pawing at the window] Wow!
Luz: Sorry! [stirs her cauldron] Sorry.
Luz: [shudders]
Luz: [rotating her shoulder] Ooh boy! Stirring is the pits. What else is on the schedule for today?
Luz: Oh, man! I'm sorry, elbow!
Luz: A crystal ball. Maybe it can show me if I'm on the right track. No, don't be tempted! It's your first day. Make a good impression. [begins to walk away; pops up at the closet and grabs the ball] Whoa!
Luz: Wow! Wait, what'd you say?
Luz: But I wasn't studying other subjects! I uh... fog brew! [tosses her potion on the ground, which doesn't work] Yeah. I figured that wouldn't work.
Luz: King! Vouch for my character!
Luz: What is this place?
Luz: [gasps] Nooooo! Detention track? But this can't be possible, I-I thought I--
Luz: But I'll be back in the human world by then.
Luz: Hello, fellow detentioners. Room for one more? [looks around] I like the little spikeys in your hair.
Luz: Hey, don't blame any of them. I'm the one that started talking.
Luz: [walks off] Aw, farts.
Luz: I do.
Luz: Oh, my gosh! I missed you so much. Let me squeeze your faces. [squeezes Willow's face]
Luz: Principal Bump put me in the detention track for mixing magic.
Luz: No, I'm better than this. Please, you gotta help me break out.
Luz: Aw, you guys.
Luz: It's the teacher. Gotta go!
Luz: [gasps] It's you!
Luz: Whoa.
Luz: What is this place?
Luz: I'm terrified! Um, I mean... I'm Luz.
Luz: Whoa.
Luz: Aah! I love secret rooms! Where do the doors go?
Luz: This place is amazing. I bet you guys can get into so much trouble in here.
Luz: You actually like school?
Luz: Sounds like Bump's priorities are out of whack.
Luz: Aw! [reaches for the marker]
Luz: Eh, they're probably looking for some other Luz.
Luz: No, no, it's not like that. I just didn't think I deserved-- I mean, none of us deserve--
Luz: I understand.
Luz: Hey, guys. [slumps onto the floor face first]
Luz: Yeah. That's right where I belong.
Luz: [sighs]
Luz: I know, but what's the point if people get hurt on the way?
Willow, Luz, and Gus: [scream]
Luz: [runs in front of her friends] Eat this!
Luz: [picks up Willow and Gus] I'll get you guys somewhere safe!
Luz: [bursts into the Secret Room of Shortcuts] Guys! I need your help!
Luz: I'm sorry for hurting your feelings, but please listen! [falls, drops Willow] Argh! Willow!
Luz: Something horrible is loose in the school.
Luz: It must've attacked the other schools, and now it's come for us. We have to do something.
Luz: Hexoleos are out there gettin' hurt, and we're the only ones who can save them. We're troublemakers, right? So let's go out there and make some trouble.
Luz: From humblest of beginnings, a hero will rise. I've trained with a secret society to discover the power of mixing magic! I am-
Luz: Wah!
Luz: Viney! Do the thing, do the thing!
Luz: Wooh!
Luz: It's all you, Barcus!
Luz: He's reading your palm, and your future looks bleak.
Luz: AH! [hugs Viney] You did it! You were amazing! You guys--
Luz: Yeah it is. But let's think about this, Principal Bump. Why would kids in the detention track need a secret hideout?
Luz: Okay, you need coven money. But if you have to hurt your students to get it, what's the point? They saved Hexside. They should be allowed to study what they wish.
Luz: Oh, I still can't choose. Maybe it's crazy but I wish I could study a little bit of everything. Whoa.
Luz: What's going on? What is this? Whoa-ho! This is so cool. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna study everything!
Luz: [gasps, chuckles] I shoulda guessed.

Luz: [voiceover] And here we have the most fearsome creature in the world, the King of Demons.
Luz: Facing his natural enemy, the ducky sock!
Luz: So, why'd you call me here again?
Luz: [zooming in with her camera] And cute little paws.
Luz: Oh, you guys are sensitive.
Luz: Bad boy!
Luz: No, no. I am so paying attention. This is my paying attention face. [nodding] Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.
Luz: [gasps] I love the rain.
Luz: [opens the door, exhales] I always love feeling the first few drops in my hair. [kneels down to talk to a flower] I bet you do too, little buddy.
Luz: What?
Luz: Huh? [yelps]
Luz: [lying painfully] Yep. [groans as a cup falls on her head] Not hurt.
Luz: [squeals, then falls over] Oh, my gosh, I love you so much. [looks at Eda, who is creating a spell under a force field] A boiling rainstorm on the Boiling Isles. The weather here is so fun.
Luz: Wow! Someday I'd like to be as cool as Eda the Owl Lady. Magical, sassy, surprisingly foxy for her age. Hey, why do they call you the Owl Lady, anyway?
Luz: You have a nest? I want a nest! Nest party! [She helps Eda up.]
Luz: [watching Eda enter the house] This is perfect. Since we'll be stuck in the house all night, Eda won't have any excuse not to teach me a spell. [follows Eda]
Luz: Oh, uh, sorry, King. But... magic.
Luz: Oh, Eda, have I told you how rad your fang looks today?
Luz: Uh, and your hair is like... girl.
Luz: Please, Eda, please. How am I supposed to earn my witch's staff if I don't know any spells?
Luz: Oh, this?
Luz: Nope. [Eda falls down.] Teach me one spell, and I'll give you your sparkle thing.
Luz: Gimme!
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Be quiet. I need to focus.
Luz: Uh, from the heart?
Luz: [gasps in joy, blushes]
Luz: Oh, gross. Can I keep that?
Luz: But how can I, little ol' Luz, do spells if I don't have a magic bile... sac?
Luz: What?
Luz: Eda!
Luz: That's it? Wait! I need to see you do the circle thingy again. I'll record it on my phone this time.
Luz: Smile! You're on camera. One more spell won't kill you.
Luz: [yelps]
Luz: Oh, my gosh. My obsession with spells knocked out Eda. I'm a monster.
Luz: We should get help, right?
Luz: But what if Eda's dead?
Luz: Well, we can't just leave her on the floor.
Luz: Sorry for pushing you, Miss Eda. Please don't hurt me when you wake up.
Luz: [rubs King's head] Just let her rest, you little goober. Come on. Let's go downstairs.
Luz: [groans, trying to draw a spell circle] This is all she does. Why you gotta be so cryptic, Owl Lady? [hits play on the video]
Luz: Not now, King. I want to figure out this spell. But if I don't have a magic sac, what's the point? I'll just be twirling my fingers around un-magically forever.
Luz: I was a nobody back home. [sits down] But becoming a witch is my chance to be someone. Do you know what it's like to have no one take you seriously?
Luz: [puts her phone away] Oh, yes, yes. You can teach me about demons all week if you help me learn this spell.
Luz: Really?
Luz: Thank you so much. You're a prince.
Luz: Right.
Luz: [takes the potion and opens it] Wow. I can't believe I'm about to learn magic. Real magic. This is historic.
Luz: Golden elixir. Gone! This is awful.
Luz: Hooty! [takes off the apron and runs]
Luz: Hooty! Are you in there? [taps his beak a few times and checks his eye] Whatever did this escaped into the rain. What could survive that?
Luz: This is terrifying. So why do you look so happy?
Luz: You want to go toward those creepy sounds? No way!
Luz: [groans]
Luz: Oh, my gosh. Eda! [runs to Eda's nest]
Luz: Eda? [holds up a damaged pillow] No! Slash marks. King! You're the demon expert. I need your help.
Luz: King! Oh, I'm so glad you're safe. [puts King down]
Luz: I was checking on Eda, and she was gone, and then you were gone. I also tripped and lost my shoe. Oh, hey, you found it. [takes it]
Luz: Curse? Wait, what are you trying to say?
Luz: Eda?
Luz: Oh, man. Did you see her eyes? They were like‐‐ [snarls] What happened to her?
Luz: Well... [holds out the pen] let's finish the lesson.
Luz: Eda's turned into some kind of demon, and we need to save her. So who knows more about demons than the best teacher in the world?
Luz: I can't. My camera's all blasted.
Luz: [sighs] You saw me. I can't draw circles in the air. I'm not like Eda. [plays the video]
Luz: [gasps] There's a pattern in the spell circle.
Luz: [grabs a leaf and the pen] It looks like this. [draws over the pattern] There.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: It's beautiful.
Luz: Oh, my gosh. I just did magic. [stands triumphantly] I just did magic! I just did magic!
Luz: I think I know how to get Eda back. Will you help me, boo‐boo buddy? [offers a fist bump]
Luz: I'm sorry, Eda. But it's for your own good.
Luz: Whoa. So are you okay?
Luz: I had some encouragement from a great teacher.
Luz: We'll take care of him. You stay in bed. [picks up Snaggleback] Come on, you goopy fella. We'll set you free now.
Luz: Welcome to the boo‐boo buddy club, Hooty.

Luz: Hey, Gus. You okay?
Luz: That angered the pixies, and they attacked Willow. I heard.
Luz: It was an honest mistake. Besides, Willow's tough as nails. I'm sure you'll both be feeling better tomorrow.
Luz: [raises fists] Gustopher! [finger points] Gusteban! [leans on the doorframe] Augustabeth! Any of those working for you?
Luz: [laughs self-consciously] I haven't been doing a good job of hiding that, huh?
Luz: Well, I was also hoping to do a little bit of... research! Come on! [drags Gus away]
Luz: So, Eda's mom told me I'm not the first human to have lived in Bonesborough. If that's true, there might be some info on how they got here in the library!
Luz: Spill it, Gustonimo. Are you okay?
Luz: I'm all for trying new things, but what's wrong with illusions?
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: [pants] Gus, you ran away so fast, but I didn't wanna interrupt so...I think you should go.
Luz: Hah! Shows what you know. Gus here is a regular super witch.
Luz: No problem. [hands him some spell glyphs] Come on, man. You know I'm all about proving jerks wrong.
Luz: "Mystery vendor floods market with dangerous human goods." Oh, Eda. "Human resident donates personal diary to library." [gasps] Yes! This must be it!
Luz: Oh! [chuckles] Hey, Ed. Hey, Em. Picking up Amity?
Luz: Oh! [steadily blushing] No, I just came here to see you, and, uh, here you are. [chuckles]
Luz: I was actually wondering if you could help me find this book? [hands her a notebook] Hundreds of years ago, there was a human named Philip Wittebane living in Bonesborough. And he donated his diary to this library.
Luz: Yes! My mom probably thinks I'm missing right now. I have to get back to her as soon as possible.
Luz: Ah!
Luz: No te preocupes. Todo va a salir bien. Like my mom always said. [chuckles, looks away] I'm sure I can find another way.
Luz: [grabs Amity's hand in both of hers] You won't lose your job. I promise.
Luz: How much further do we have to go?
Luz: Whoa. Let's get lookin'.
Luz: So, we'll be super sneaky and quiet. Got it.
Luz: I know here that probably means unholy, blood-sucking snake monster, but in the Human Realm, that's just a cute name for nerds.
Luz: Maybe it would be less odd if I showed you around someday. But, uh, let's turn back. I don't wanna push you.
Luz: Wooh!
Luz: [gasps] [pulls out Philip's diary, squeals]
Luz: [gasps] You little rat! ["rat" echoes] Oh, no.
Luz: Amity, I am so--
Luz: [also tearing up, nearly crying] It's okay. I, uh-- [sniffles] I do stupid things around you too, Amity.
Luz: [cries, takes breath and slicks hair back] Nada funcionará a menos que lo haga funcionar.
Luz: I'm sorry about everything! I understand if you never wanna see me again. Uh--
Luz: It's different.
Luz: [shakes a vine off her arm] Well, to convince Malphas to hire you again, I had to go through some trials. And categorize some man-eating books- and, tame something called a paper dragon? That guy was not fun. [notices Edric and Emira] Oh, hey, guys.
Luz: Agh- [shakes leg, getting the echo mouse on her leg to scurry off of it] You're the one who ate the diary! Uaagh!! [jumps after it, catching it but landing on her face] I hate you.
Luz: Thank you, little mouse. I hope you and I can become good friends.

Luz: Prepare thyself to do battle like a human! Thumb war!!
Luz: Oh my gosh Willow, I'm so excited for photo class! I can't believe you can make pictures of your actual memories! [opens locker] I'ma see me some baby Willow!
Luz: Don't eat that. [pulls at the book] Whoa! [falls]
Luz: Hiss! [stands]
Luz: That could be anyone!
Luz: Alright memory melon, let's pick another juicy one!
Luz: Ooo, who says brain surgery is hard?
Luz: All the colors of the brainbow.
Luz: Whoa. Photo class is intense.
Luz: Oh my gosh, Willow, you had an awkward hair phase, too? I knew we were meant to be friends.
Luz: Ooo, there's more!
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Hey, I know you and Amity have a history. Wouldn't you feel better talking about it?
Luz: If you won't tell me what she did, I'll never be able to cook up a scheme to make you friends again.
Luz: [looks at the photos] She never did mention anything about... shenanigans.
Luz: Wait up!
Luz: Hey there, detective. Are you solving a crime or about to commit one?
Luz: Okay buddy, okay. [gives Gus apple blood] So, Willow-- whoa. Are you okay?
Luz: Gus, it really seems like she's forgotten us, like her memory is- [gasps] Like her memory is gone!
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: You destroyed Willow's memories?!
Luz: Yup.
Luz: When the night critters allow me to.
Luz: Is there anything we can do?
Luz: Be still my fantasy loving heart, I have always wanted to do this! Thank you, Boiling Isles.
Luz: Gus... has a lot on his plate. Amity, you have to go with me.
Luz: You set everything in there on fire! You have to help.
Luz: [takes bell] Whoa.
Luz and Amity: Ah!
Luz: AH! [almost falls]
Luz: I don't know. We'll just have to start fixing stuff on our own! Hmm, now let's see...
Luz: [poking it more times] Hey, I found something magical. I'ma put my face in it! [laughs as she enters the picture]
Luz: [sticks her head out the picture] I think I found the memories. Let's go! [drags Amity in]
Luz: Woo!
Luz: [sits up] And welcome to Willow's beautiful... memory?
Luz: Forts, hooky, Willow. Can words get any cuter?
Luz: Wha? It's like dog house for angels!
Luz: I think fixing the fort fixed the memory!
Luz: I know, but now she's more like a great bloomer! This place is like theater showing her most important moments! Now let's fix some more! [runs up to the birthday party picture] The photo that started it all! Let's do it next.
Luz: Hmm, don't mind if I do! [laughs]
[Cut to Willow's mind. Montage of Luz and Amity fixing Willow's memories: Willow and her dads playing on the swings. Willow and Amity reading 13+ romance novels only to run from the librarian. Amity waving for Willow to join her on the "Roller Ghoster."]
Luz: We don't need to see how this one ends... [turns the memory around]
Luz: Ew... I mean, aw!
Luz: Hey, you okay?
Luz: Don't worry. We've gotten really good at fixing memories! I won't rest until we've got this all sorted out. Repeat after me: "We can fix this together!" Come on!
Luz: Heck yeah we can! I know some of these memories must be painful for you, but, what happened to you guys? And why are you trying to hide it?
Luz: Look, if you don't wanna talk about it, just say so. [walks off]
Luz: If you need me, I shall be fixing this memory of a ball pit.
Luz: [enters, immediately ducks back out with an egg on her head] It's eggs! It's full of eggs! Why is this memory full of eggs?!
Luz: [inhales] Phew! [tosses egg] Yeah. And there's only one last memory to fix! The one you're suspiciously avoiding.
Luz: Amity, you gotta stop being weird. We have to fix all of them. Unless... there's something in there you don't want me to see.
Luz: Look, I'm not here to judge, I'm just here to help Willow.
Luz and Amity: [gasps]
Luz: Look!
Luz: Oh no! That thing is burning up all the memories!
Luz: Yeah... she's not super reliable.
Luz: Run!
Luz: I don't know. [looks at the swing photo] That one hasn’t been burned, [looks at the holiday photo] or that one! [looks at the library photo, gasps] Amity, that thing isn't after any photo. It's after you!
Luz: Run! I have an idea! [shoves Amity to the beach photo]
Luz: Just trust me!
Luz: Time for a swimming lesson!
Luz: Woo! Teamwork baby!
Luz: Please! Stop!
Luz: You're saying it all creepy, but I like the sound of-- whoa!
Luz: Where are we?
Luz: Amity!
Luz: Then, if it's okay, Amity and I still have some work to do.
Luz: So, does this mean you and Willow are buddies again?
Luz: Well, [pulls out bell] why don't we go see? [rings bell]
Luz: Whoa. What went down here? Where's Gus? What did you do with Gus?
Luz: Those are very mixed messages.
Luz: Willow! Do you know who I am?
Luz: She's back, folks! My girl's back! I'm gonna hug you so hard you'll never forget me again! [hugs her]
Luz: You said nothing about shenanigans...

Luz: My first Grudgby season! I’m so excited, I have more school spirit than the school spirits!
Luz: You mean “glory days”?
Luz: Cheating isn’t anything to brag about. How do you know you were any good if all you did was cheat your way to victory?
Luz: Well, can’t reason with crazy. [pulls a sleeping King out of her hood] Bye King, you little snoozers.
Luz: [to Gus and Willow] I can’t wait for Grudgby season to start! I’ve studied up on all sorts of magical sports. Like this. [holds up a DVD case] Good Witch Azura 2: The Field of Deadly Fates. A classic underdog tale.
Luz: [grabbing the DVD from Gus] Not food.
Luz: What’s going on? It’s like all of Hexside’s caught Willow fever!
Luz: Hey, I agree, my friend is very cute. But give that back!
Luz: We are having zero fun, I swear. Boscha’s picking on us.
Luz: Don’t worry, it’s not like she can follow us around all day, right?
Luz: She followed us around all day. She literally followed us around all day!
Luz: We will find a way out of this. 
Luz: Amity! 
Luz: Amity, we need your help.
Luz: Boscha won’t stop picking on Willow, and no one will do anything about it because she’s the “Star Captain of the Grudgby Team.”
Luz: You’re friends with her, can you help us? 
Luz: Hmm. Okay, okay. I’m pickin' up what you’re puttin' down. 
Luz: Willow! What happened?
Luz: That’s it! Boscha! Willow challenges you to... a grudgby match! 
Luz: I’m just following Amity’s advice. Boscha only speaks in Grudgby terms. Trust me, I have a plan. 
Luz: That’s right! We’ll settle this once and for all on the field.
Luz: If Willow’s team wins, you don’t get to pick on her anymore.
Luz: Ha! That’s not even a punishment. I love water. 
Luz: But you’re the better witch. I don’t know much about sports, but I know about sports movies. We, too, are a ragtag team of lovable misfits joined together to defeat a powerful enemy. With a little team spirit and a training montage, we can win. 
Luz: What about you, Amity? 
Luz: Huh? Well, I guess she’s out. In any case, let’s get training! 
Luz: So, how exactly do we play Grudgby? 
Luz: That sounds easy.
Luz: Oh, right. Boiling Isles. Should have predicted this. 
Luz: Alright! Every great sports story includes a training montage. 
Luz: Well…
Luz: What happens in the montage stays in the montage! Now let’s hit the field.
Luz: Now for our big finale! Let’s try... [activates a plant glyph] the Thorn Vault. [puts glyph on ground]
Luz: Guys, let’s try the Thorn Vault one more time. 
Luz: But we’re the underdogs, we have to stay upbeat and keep trying and—
Luz: Willow, wait! 
Luz: I pushed Willow and Gus too hard. It’s just, I hate seeing Willow get picked on. She’s one of the best friends I’ve ever had. Winning this game is the only way I know how to help. 
Luz: Really?
Luz: Good Witch Azura 2: Field of Deadly Fates! You watched it too?
Luz: Wah! Sorry. [helps Amity up] I just really love backstories.
Luz: [putting something in Amity’s hand] I know what to do to make this up to Willow. Thanks. [leaves]
Luz: I’m here on her behalf. We forfeit.
Luz: And I’m here to tell you that I’ll take Willow’s place as your water gofer, target practice, whatever you need. 
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Willow! [runs up to her] Willow, I’m sorry I got you into this mess. You’re right, I got my head too stuck in the movie biz.
Luz: Nice work.
Luz: Whoa.
Luz: [gasps] Fire magic! [throws ball] Amity!
Luz: Here’s what I have to offer. [holds out fire, light, plant, and ice glyphs]
Luz: [gasps] The Thorn Vault? Are you sure? 
Luz: Ha!
Luz: Amity!
Luz: Whoo! [hugs Willow] You did it, Willow! We did it! We Won! 
Luz: Wait, what?
Luz: Wh- What happened?
Luz: The what?
Luz: That just invalidates all our efforts! If catching that thing is so important, why do anything else? There’s no reason to watch any of the other players! That’s such a stupid rule!
Luz and Willow: Amity! [runs up to her]
Luz: Are you sure? I could help carry you if it really hurts.
Luz: Aaaaand, scoop! [she picks Amity up]
Luz: Yeah! Montage, activate! 
Luz: [chuckles]

Luz: [rolls over, breathes heavily]
Luz: Stop adorably hopping away, you... Huh?
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: [wakes up with a gasp and looks around the room]
Luz: It wasn't a dream! [opens the window] Good morning, terrifying fantasy world.
Luz: Ughhh.
Luz: [picks up King] Good morning, you little cutie‐pie. [kisses his head repeatedly]
Luz: Yes, you are. [hugs him tightly before putting him back down on her sleeping bag.]
Luz: [screams and karate chops Hooty's face]
Luz: Sorry, Hooty. [Looks at the bathroom counter and picks up her Azura book. Flips it open to a headshot of Azura and holds it up to the mirror] This is it, old girl. Your first day on the Boiling Isles, as a Witch Apprentice. [punches the air] Hyah! [opens a closet door while covering her eyes] Please have witchy clothes. Please have witchy clothes. Please have witchy clothes. [takes her hand off her eyes and sees a closet full of stereotypical witchy stuff] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! [screams]
Luz: [squeals]
Luz: Good morning, Eda the Owl Lady. I am ready for my first day of Witch Apprenticeship.
Luz: Huh? [stares in horror as her name tag falls to the floor]
Luz: [following Eda into the kitchen] Remember me? Luz? [grunts as a coffee cup hits her in the back of the head] We freed the oppressed and defeated the evil warden together? Yesterday?
Luz: You mean apple juice?
Luz: Teach me some spells. When do I get a magic staff? Was I supposed to bring my own runes? [gasps] Do you have a dangerous magical quest for me?
Luz: More than anything.
Luz: [pulls a bottle from the bag and reads the label] "Snake oil."
Luz: I won't let you down, Miss Eda.
Luz: Uh...
Luz: [squishes her face against the window] No, I won't.
Luz: Woah!
Luz: I've only seen places like this in my dreams. It's incredible. And I'm the only human here?
Luz: Wow! There must be a reason for that, right? Why am I here? What if I, Luz Noceda, average teen, actually had... [gasps] ...a predetermined path of greatness? [gasps] Just like Azura!
Luz: Today I'm delivering packages, but tomorrow I'll be earning the respect of everyone on the Boiling Isles with my magical prowess.
Luz: More like a cesspool of delight.
Luz: What has four hooves and wants to buy a potion? This guy.
Luz: [exclaims]
Luz: I thought being the only human in a magical world would make me special. But apparently, it just makes everyone want to scream at me or... [holds up her arm to reveal a small winged creature biting her elbow] eat me. [flings the creature away and sighs, opening her book] At this point, Azura had already been sent on an enchanted quest. Where's my quest‐granting wizard?
Luz: This has been a rough day. [stands and hefts the potions sack over her shoulder with a grunt; takes out a piece of paper and starts down the alley] Let's just deliver this last package and go home. Maybe this world isn't what I thought it wa‐‐ [gasps] Pretty!
Luz: [walking inside and ignoring King] Hello?
Luz: [entering a room] I‐I'm delivering a package from Miss Eda, the Owl Lady. Huh?
Luz: [gasps] Today just got good.
Luz: [dancing excitedly] Magical wizard!
Luz: Uh, I‐I'm‐‐
Luz: [gasps] Okay.
Luz: But the stars on his robe are sparkling. And look, there's a baby fox in his beard.
Luz: Plus, I see scones on the table.
Luz: We'd love to join you for tea.
Luz: [turns and notices a cart of potions] Do you sell potions, Sir Wizard?
Luz: Well, I'm kinda, sorta, her apprentice.
Luz: [holds a fake grin before sighing] Can I be honest, Mr. Adegast? When I decided to stay in this magical world, I thought I was meant for something special. But Eda thinks I'm meant for chores and I'm afraid I came to the wrong place.
Luz: A quest?
Luz: Oh.
Luz: Yes!
Luz: Perhaps I hath. [takes the map]
Luz: [follows him] So worthy.
Luz: Love peril. Big fan of peril.
Luz: [stops walking] Chosen one.
Luz: Yes, we have to go. And pack for this enchanted quest! I'm in.
Luz: So, King, what kind of Chosen One should I be?
Luz: [picks up her book] Should I be full of optimism and goodness, like the Good Witch Azura? Or should I be like a bad girl Chosen One with black nail polish and a mysteriously withdrawn attitude? [uses the book as a mouth] "I act like I don't care, but I secretly do."
Luz: What?
Luz: Can I have some time alone?
Luz: Maybe they were right. [leans against the wall before sliding down it to the floor] Huh?
[Sunlight is illuminating one corner of the map, revealing the word "one" in shining blue lettering. Luz holds the entire map up to the light revealing the message: "The chosen one The path will only appear to the worthy".]
Luz: "The path will only appear to the worthy." [gasps] That's why Eda couldn't see it. But am... I really worthy?
Luz: I'll never know unless I try.
Luz: [inhales] My first mythical quest. Ha!
Luz: Okay. Got my scroll, got my youthful optimism, got my trusty weapon. [pulls out the sword and hits a button on it]
Luz: You know, I wonder if I made the right choice by coming here. [gasps] Wow!
Luz: [staring at his biceps] Yes. Yes, I did make the right choice.
Luz: Nevareth, your vengeful backstory is so compelling. And I'm lovin' your animal sidekick.
Luz: Nevareth!
Luz: [turns and laughs to herself] This quest is questing in all the right ways.
Luz: Hit me, little furry man.
Luz: Hmm. [bends down to inspect his nametag] Uh... Chris?
Luz: Wow. This is amazing. Thank you. [puts the ring on]
Luz: Nah, I think I'm goo‐‐
Luz: Yes. I need a cape. [giggles]
Luz: Thank you for inviting me to your feast, Princess. All your food was so tiny and cute.
Luz: [puts the bracelets on] Thank you. You have all been so kind and thoughtful. [jumps and strikes a pose] I hope this quest never ends.
Luz: [drops her pose] Thanks for ruining the mood, Chris.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: I knew this world wasn't all gloom and doom like Eda and King said. [skipping and twirling down the walkway] There is wonder here. And I... I think I came here for a reason.
Luz: Okay, this is it. Moment of truth.
Luz: Yes! I am the Chosen One! I knew it! I always suspected there was a reason nobody understood my wacky antics back at home. [jumps and twirls in a circle, then holds the staff with both hands] Now I have concrete proof. [laughs]
Luz: No!
Luz: What?
Luz: [whimpers]
Luz: Magical wizard?
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Okay, Luz. Don't panic. This is classic Chosen One biz. You just have to rescue everybody and defeat the final boss.
Luz: What?
Luz: No! Betrayed by my own cool accessories. Why are you doing this?
Luz: Does everybody have a beef with Eda here?
Luz: [sighs]
Luz: No. Joke's on you, 'cause Eda isn't stupid enough to fall for your trap.
Luz: Oh, heck!
Luz: It is beautiful here.
Luz: And you guys think I'm special.
Luz: But it's not real. [grunts and waves the fog away, running forward to pick up her sword] I am a Witch's Apprentice. And I'm gonna earn my magic staff the hard way. I believed you, Magic Man. Now feel my wrath!
Luz: I thought we had a connection, Nevareth! [plunges her sword through his chest]
Luz: King, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you and never trusted that wizard. You were right. He isn't mystical or magical. He's just a big, slimy jerk.
Luz: No. I'm just confused.
Luz: This place is nothing like I imagined.
Luz: [takes the blindfold off] Whoa!
Luz: It's beautiful.
Luz: Eda, how did you know that wizard was lying?
Luz: Does that mean you'll give me a magic staff of my own?

"Luz": [stretches] Ah, much better.
"Luz": Hmm.
"Luz": Just… cleaning up a little. [smiles and looks down at the box]
"Luz": Oh, I'm uh… [takes back the tin foil swan] just looking for a fresh start!
"Luz": Camp taught me a lot, you know? [sets down box beside the trash can]
"Luz": That's the 5th trap this week!
"Luz": [smiles] A new life. ["Luz" opens the cupboard to take out a shirt, then closes it. The reflection changes into the real Luz looking at "Luz" with an angry expression.]
Luz: You! [slams her hands on the mirror]
Luz: So, according to Philip's instructions, the hardest part to making a portal was finding someone who knew how to build it. [puts something on the door] But a lot of the ingredients are pretty easy to find. [turns to look at Eda] Your crazy apocalypse supplies finally came in handy Eda!
Luz: [stands up] Titan blood. I can't believe something this powerful was in the old key this whole time.
Luz: It's okay. If Belos is still trying to get to the human realm, he'll have to beat me to it!
Luz: Nope!
Luz: It… worked! [runs toward the door]
Luz: Yeah. [takes over her cloak from Eda] But this is my one chance to see my mom. [Ties a rope on her waist] If it looks like it's closing, pull!
Luz: Once I make sure my mom is okay, I'll be right back.
Luz: Mmm!
Luz: Okay.
Luz: Did I… do something wrong? [shouts] Eda? King? Hooty? [more cubes appear] Can anyone hear me?
Luz: Am I… back at the Owl House?
Luz: Whoa! Whoa, I think I'm… in the reflection! [taps on the window]
Luz: I wonder if I can see… Amity! [blushes]
Luz: Ah! Ugh! No no no! [pushes the cube down back into the water] Come on Luz, you're on a mission! [squeezes in between her nose] Camila! Camila Noceda of the human realm?
Luz: Got ya! Ice platform!
Luz: [angrily] Fine then! I'll do this the hard way!
Luz: Mom!
Luz: [gasps] It's my house!
Luz: Mom!
Luz: [tears rolling down cheeks] Mo-
"Luz": Mom? Do you need any help?
"Luz": Almost! With all that old stuff gone, I feel like a whole new person.
Luz: [shocked] Evil doppelgänger! Mom! Mom! [knocks on cellphone's glass] Mom! Mom!
"Luz": Thanks, Mom! [runs off to her room]
Luz: Follow her! Luz Noceda 2.0! Doppelgänger! Why won't you work?! [exasperated sigh] Okay Luz, calm down. Just breathe and count to 5.
"Luz": A new life. [closes cupboard door, notices real Luz in the reflection]
Luz: [angrily] You!
Luz: So you can hear me.
"Luz": [scared] You're from the demon realm.
Luz: Listen, I just wanna-
"Luz": [blinks] I'm not going back! I- I won't go back! [picks up a red baseball bat and attempts to break the mirror]
Luz: Sí, mama! I just saw a spoiler from Monster Slayer Academia!
Luz: [looks at "Luz" and shrugs] Hmm?
Luz: Wait!
"Luz": So this is it. I'm gonna have to run… again. [sad expression] Why couldn't this just WORK OUT?!
Luz: Stop moving! You'll make it tighter!
Luz: I didn't mean to freak you out. I just want to figure out what's going on, okay? You're a demon from the Boiling Isles, aren't you?
Luz: [smiles] What's your name?
Luz: Okay Vee, I'm gonna help free you. You're gonna be alright. Now, back up a bit, give the wire some slack. Now, look for a little metal thingamabobber. [apologetically] Sorry, I don't know what it's called.
Luz: There you go, nice and easy.
Luz: I am. But right now, I'm trapped in the Boiling Isles. Who are you, why are you pretending to be me?
Luz: Wait wait wait! Maybe we can help each other! Today I was gonna tell my mom where I've been, but because of you, she hasn't realized that I've been missing! So, keep living in my place! For now. When I get back, I can introduce her to the demon realm and help you find a place to live.
Luz: Hmm… [thinks while looks to Vee's left] Oh! [points] That's where we can get some magic!
Luz: No no, that's junk, turn it over.
Luz: That's Eda, the Owl Lady, she's been coming here for years. She might have left some magic stuff behind!
Luz: Yes. [turns to look at the café] Maybe they still have one of her enchanted pastries! [turns back] Huh? [points at her ears] Ears! Ears!
Luz: Cool! Talking rats! Maybe they know something.
Luz: Vee? Is everything alright?
Luz: Oh! Well, that's okay, I'm sure there's someone else who's seen Eda. [gasps] There!
Luz: Hexes Hold'em cards! Eda got rid of all her decks. I was wondering where they went…
Luz: But maybe they know where to get more! Okay, we gotta be carfeful approaching high schoolers. Mark all your exit routes-
Luz: Ah! Wait, hey!
Luz: [panics] Oh, she's gonna embarrass herself! [covers her face] I can't watch…
Luz: Camp?
Luz: This is it!
Luz: Are you okay? Hey, forget what that girl said! I know what it's like to run away from home. I did the same thing.
Luz: I met a basilisk once. She hurt a lot of people.
Vee (as Luz): [nervously] Hello... fellow human! Um... skin's sure weird!
Luz: Where's the light?
Luz: [increasingly panicked] Vee? Vee? VEE?
Luz (in reflection): Vee!
Luz: Don't worry Vee, we can get out of this...
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Vee! You're giving up too quick!
Luz: NO!
Luz: Vee! Five! Number 5! Agh! [punches black water]
Luz: [pauses, now more confident] Camila Noceda.
Luz: Mom, are you there?
Luz: Mom. It's go great to hear your voice.
Luz: I found out who's setting up those traps, and he's... hurting a friend of mine. But first... I have to tell you the truth. About the last few months. Let me tell you about a place called Boiling Isles.
Luz: I'm not making it up, Mom.
Luz: It's not a game, Mama. Everything I told you was true.
Luz: Her name is Vee and she may look different but she's not bad, please, you gotta help her!
Luz: Heh! Look what I can do with the rain! Vee! I'm so happy you're okay!
Luz: Woah.
Luz: Mom, you were AWESOME back there! Thanks for being cool... about everything.
Luz: I... I need a little more time, but if I keep working my hardest I will make a working portal, I promise!
Luz: Yes! I've learned so much... Staying here was the best decision I ever made.
Luz: Oh, uh...
Luz: Mama, no!
Luz: No. [pulls herself down on the rope] Not yet. Not... yet! MOM!
Luz: I'm being pulled back!
Luz: [starts tearing up] Mom, it's not you, it never was!
Luz: [sad expression] Okay, mom. I promise. [fades away from view]
Luz: MOM! [tears dripping from her eyes]
Luz: Yeah. Mama... Mom can't wait to meet you guys.

[Luz stares at the tag on her cape, reading: 'To a young witch from her proud mentor EDA'.]
Luz: I don't care what Belos is up to... because today, I'm saving Eda!
Luz: This is serious, King. Eda used her power to save me and got caught by Lilith. Now she's the Owl Beast and is being taken before the Emperor! I don't know what he's planning to do with Eda, but I'm going to rescue her.
Luz: King, please try to understand. Eda is in this situation because of me. Because of my stupid choice. I have to make up for it.
Luz: I don't know. But I have to try anyway.
Luz: King...
Luz: Alright. Then we've got no time to lose! [runs out of the room]
Luz: Please tell me that's not as bad as it sounds.
Luz: Lilith. She cursed Eda. She captured her own sister! She is the worst! If I ever see her again!
Luz: [sighs] You're right, but how will we get to the Conformatorium in time?
Luz: Hey!
Luz and King: Whaaa?
Luz: Yep.
Luz: Perfect plan.
Luz and King: [gasp]
Luz: [growls]
Luz: [screams and slams an ice glyph on the ground]
Luz: Where's Eda?
Luz: Draw me a map!
Luz: King, watch the door.
Luz: Eda? Eda!
Luz: [pulls out an activated light glyph] Eda, wait! It's me! It's me.
Luz: It's okay Eda, I'm here to save you.
Luz: But, but I can't! It's my fault you needed to save me. It's my fault you got captured.
Luz: Eda...
Luz: But we're a family! Us weirdos have to stick together, remember?
Luz: [looks at Eda with tears in her eyes before tucking the key under her cloak and hugging her] I love you, Eda.
Luz: No! [runs forward and grabs a hold of the bottom of Eda's claw] Not yet!
Luz: Eda!
Luz: You. You hurt Eda. You put her in chains. And now, I will take you down! [yells as she jumps at Lilith, activating spell cards]
Luz: Talk to the glyph, witch!
Luz: [dives out of the way of Lilith's spell and pulls a fire glyph out] Fire! [the glyph disintegrates in her hands] What?
Luz: No way! You deserve to be petrified! Not Eda!
Luz: Why did you do all this?
Luz: How do I know I can trust you?
Luz: Owlbert! You're okay.
Luz: All right, Lilith. I don't like your whole, [she points at Lilith and traces a circle with her finger] deal, but... [her expression softens] we need your help to save Eda.
Luz: No. I'm coming.
Luz: Thank you, Lilith. What will you do now?
Luz: That's good to hear. [looks around] Wait, why are there no guards around?
Luz: Lilith!
Luz: King!
Luz: No!
Luz: Let my friends go, or else!
Luz: [screams]
Luz: Huh? Ah!
Luz: [smirks] Not even close. [moves her hand to reveal an ice glyph]
Luz: But... my home.
Luz: [reaches for the ceiling, for Eda] No! [grabs the clasp of her cloak as a tear runs down her cheek] Fine! [reaches under her cloak and activates the portal door, keeping the key out of sight of Belos. She hugs the door to her chest.] Lo siento, mamá. [grabs Eda's staff and stands, reluctantly walking towards Belos and holding out the door] Here, it's yours.
Luz: I may have lost, but so have you.
Luz: [activates a fire glyph as she walks behind Kikimora] Free them, now!
Luz: Eda! Are you okay?
Luz: Don't worry, Eda. I'll run and get you some elixir and--
Luz: Eda!
Luz: Can you still do magic?
Luz: It's okay. I can teach you what I know, and what we don't know, we can learn together.
Luz: [voiceover] And that's how we escaped from the Emperor.
Luz: Everyone told me he was the most powerful witch alive.
Luz: But look at this, Mom. [holds up the chip of Belos's mask] I chipped off a piece of his mask! I know he's not invincible now. [her expression falls] It's a strange feeling, having gone through so much and, not having you here to share it with. And I don't know when or how I'm gonna see you again. [puts her phone down and looks at a picture of her and Camila, then at the ball of light hovering in front of her] But I will find my way home to you. I promise. Deja una luz puesta para mí. Te quiero.

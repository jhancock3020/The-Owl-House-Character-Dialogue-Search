Vee: Ah! [pants] Thank you. [sobs] You must be Camila's real daughter.
Vee: I am… just looking for a place to belong.
Vee: You're missing and mom… I mean, Camila seemed so kind, so I stayed with her but uh, I'll go if you-
Vee: There's one problem. I need magic to transform and I uh… just used the rest of it.
Vee: Secrets of Gravesfield?
Vee: Strange woman banned form café.
Vee: Okay! [picks up the mirror] We can try.
Vee: Is this it? Huh I- I just go in and ask about that witch from the paper?
Vee: [Walks towards counter] Uh, have any um, magical old ladies left enchanted items here?
Vee: [frightened expression, looks up and points] Actually I'm asking about her.
Vee: I don't… smell any magic. [hears hissing sound] Huh?
Vee: Oh, [laughs] yeah, I- I just don't like confrontation. [chuckles nervously]
Vee: [sniffing] Well, they must've run out of magic, I don't… smell anything.
Vee: [laughs] Actually, these guys are cool. [starts walking towards the high schoolers]
Vee: Hello!
Vee: [laughs] Come on! Camp wasn't that bad.
Vee: We did have the best cabin!
Vee and the high schoolers: CABIN 7! Hoo-ha-ha! [laughing]
Vee: Cool cards! Where'd you get 'em?
Vee: [nervous noise]
Vee: [dejectedly] Thanks. I'll see you around.
Vee: How did you know?
Vee: Yes please!
Vee: You and I are not the same. You had a mom who loved you, a home, a life, you had it GOOD! And you STILL wanted to run away, I... I didn't have a choice. My real name is... Number 5. I'm a basilisk, and technically, I... I shouldn't exist.
Vee: [narrating] My kind went extinct a long time ago, but we were brought back.
Vee: They wanted to know how we drained magic.
Vee: For many of us, all we knew how to do was feed.
Vee: Some of us escaped, but I knew it was only a matter of time before HE caught us again.
Vee: That's when I saw you, and... and realised there might be a way out of this!
Vee: Eeh! [transforms into a replica of Luz]
Vee (as Luz): [nervously] Hello... fellow human! Um... skin's sure weird!
Vee: [narrating] I didn't mean to keep playing this role, but... Camila was nice to me.
Vee: I resent you for running away. But I'm also thankful that you did. I dunno. It's... confusing.
Vee: Do you smell something?
Vee: What is all this?
Vee: [stressed, revealing true form] LET ME OUT!
Vee: You... don't actually know anything about us, do you?
Vee: Go back to the demon realm, Luz.
Vee: Even if I get out, he knows what my disguise looks like. He'd out me to Camila and it'd would cause her more trouble than if you just disappeared.
Vee: I'm being realistic. It's okay, I'm used to living like this. Goodbye, Luz.
Vee: Is it okay to leave him in there?
Vee: Yeah. Thank you, Camila. For everything.
Vee: Magic!

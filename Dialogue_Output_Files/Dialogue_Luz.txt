Luz: And that's the end.
Luz: My book report. [the snake hisses and bites the doll] I think I knocked it out of the park.
Luz: Oh. That's where the backup snakes were.
Luz: That was for the Act Three closer.
Luz: O happy dagger, give me death!
Luz: Now for the final anatomically correct touch, spider breath.
Luz: You think that's an impressive trick? [throws her pom-poms to the side] Take a look at this. [turns around to reveal she flipped her eyelids inside out] Bleep, bloop, bleep!
Luz: Don't worry, Mom. I won't let you down. [stands up triumphantly] No more weirdness!
Luz: That doesn't count, right?
Luz: But I don't like any of that stuff. I like editing anime clips to music and- and reading fantasy books with convoluted backstories.
Luz: Yes, Mom.
Luz: Bye, Mom. [watches her leave, then gasps and rummages through the bin] Where is it? Where is it?
Luz: Tiny trash thief!
Luz: [growls]
Luz: Stop adorably hopping away, you‐‐ Huh? [looks around the tent, which is full of old odds and ends] Whoa. I thought I had a lot of weird stuff. [grabs a creepy-looking doll] But this? This is impressive.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: [gasps; runs out of the tent and grabs her book back] Excuse me, sorry, it's mine, thank you.
Luz: Wah-ah!
Luz: [backing away from the cliff] Oh, no, no, no, no! What's going on? [shrieks as a fairy approaches her] Oh, hello, little fairy. Are you going to tell me this is all a fantastical dream?
Luz: [screams, slaps the fairy into the ground] Where am I? Did I die? Am I in the bad place?
Luz: [sits down on a stool] I'm so sorry! I just wanted my book! If you're gonna eat my skin, [offers her arm and closes her eyes] just make it quick! Just do it now!
Luz: [opens her eyes]
Luz: [looks at the middle-aged woman and laughs] That's not all it can do. Here, let me see it.
Luz: Voilà!
Luz: I'm Luz. Luz Noceda.
Luz: That's kind of a weird thing for another human to say.
Luz: A witch?
Luz: [peeking over the edge of the table] Whoa! Witch criminal!
Luz: Aah!
Luz: Wh‐What? That's not cool!
Luz: [following Eda] This is crazy. If I die here, my mom's gonna kill me!
Luz: Wait. What's that supposed to‐‐
Luz: [does so, yells and nearly falls off the staff when she sees the ground below them] Flying staffs, crazy monsters, you're a witch! What is this place?
Luz: A griffin!
Luz: I knew it!
Luz: Giraffes?
Luz: Aaah! [jumps off the staff]
Luz: [stands] Well, I've had enough adventure for today. This is clearly not the PG fantasy world I always dreamed about. So, can you help me get back home?
Luz: Whoa!
Luz: [looking over her shoulder] Aren't you worried about those guards finding us?
Luz: This place is beautiful! [puts her book onto a coffee table] Do you live here all alone?
Luz: [gasps] ¡Ay, que lindo! [runs forward and scoops King up in a hug] Eda, he's so cute! Who's a widdle guy? Who's a widdle guy? Is it you? Is it you?
Luz: Wait, wait, wait. I don't like the sound of this "situation".
Luz: You mean this little bundle of joy?
Luz: So I don't really have a choice, do I?
Luz: Where are we going?
Luz: [notices Eda's wanted poster on the wall they're hiding behind] Whoa. These guys really have the hots for you.
Luz: [gasps] Will I need a disguise?
Luz: I've been waiting to use this. [pulls her hood on, flicks up cat ears] Meow, meow.
Luz: Whoa!
Luz: [also grunting as she pulls herself up and in, falling on her face]
Luz: [sits up and gasps]
Luz: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not a cat. [pulls her hood down] Also, I'm not a criminal.
Luz: [pacing around] Wait. These aren't crimes. None of you actually did anything wrong. [pulls out Eda's wanted poster] You're all just a bunch of weirdos. Like me.
Luz: [exclaims and runs into an open cell, pulling the door down as she enters]
Luz: [whimpers]
Luz: Don't worry. I can get you out. [pulls on the lever, but can't lift it] No! My weak nerd arms!
Luz: It's not fair that they're all in here. They just want to be themselves. Why does everyone think that being a weirdo is so bad?
Luz: [takes a breath]
[Luz puts a hand against the pillar before walking through it. Inside are piles of what can only be described as as junk: everything from books to skulls to a dead fish in a tank. Atop the central one is a glowing crown.]
Luz: Wait a second. Is that a...
Luz: That crown doesn't give him any powers, does it?
Luz: [grins and blushes]
Luz: [screams]
Luz: [screams louder and longer]
Luz: Eda! Are you okay?
Luz: Does it?
Luz: [disgusted] What?
Luz: I hate everything you're saying right now.
Luz: Okay, we're going now.
Luz: Expecto... flying? Magicus... escapicus!
Luz: Eda, lend me a hand!
Luz: What about you guys?
Luz: But‐‐ But I‐‐
Luz: [whimpering as she tries to not fall off the staff]
Luz: Why are you guys just standing there? This is your chance to escape!
Luz: So, you have a different way of doing things, a different way of seeing things. That might make you weird, but it also makes you awesome. Don't you see?
Luz: Because us weirdos have to stick together. [pulls her hood on and mounts the staff] And nobody should be punished for who they are.
Luz: Now, let's get 'em!
Luz: Go, go, go, go!
Luz: [points at Wrath] Do not underestimate me, Warden Wrath, for I am Luz, the human, warrior of peace. [wind blows her hair] Now eat this, sucka!
Luz: Before I go... [holds out the head of her Azura doll] I know it's not the same, but... [removes Azura's crown] a king shouldn't be without a crown.
Luz: [gasps]
Luz: Okay. I know you got your head cut off, and we started some kind of prison riot, but this was the most fun I've ever had.
Luz: I don't fit in at home. You don't fit in here. If I stay, we could not fit in together. [she looks at the pamphlet for Reality Check one last time, then crumples it] I'm not going back to summer camp.
Luz: I want to stay and become a witch. Like you. [holds her book up to Eda] And Azura.
Luz: Maybe that's because they haven't tried. If you teach me to become a witch, I'll do anything you want.
[Luz sits up and pats the sleeping bag. King curls up at the bottom below her feet and falls asleep. Luz smiles at him before replying to her mom: I think I'm gonna like it here". Smiling, she puts her phone down, turns to the side, and falls asleep.]
